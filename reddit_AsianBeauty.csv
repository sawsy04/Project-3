8,AsianBeauty,"[Journal] A bout of cystic acne, and how daily consistency saved my skin","While I was on birth control, nothing, and I repeat, nothing, could make my skin break out. Not the products that made me feel really crappy while it was on my skin. Not a big bag of spicy chips (Chile Limon potato chips, to be specific). Not consumption of a whole jar of kimchi in one day. Not looming ""period"" that wasn't, you know, real period, because I was on birth control after all.

I had been off of birth control for 7 months when the most horrible breakout happened: 3 acne cysts, 1 on the left cheek and 2 on the right cheek. It happened maybe after I ate a whole jar of kimchi in a day (don't judge kimchi is goodness damn it). And overnight, there they were.

During the 7 months between stopping birth control and the 3 acne cysts, my skin didn't get crappy overnight. Just like how birth control helped my skin over time, so did stopping it. The first two months were barely noticeable. Minimal break out close to period, but nothing major. And then the really obvious hormonal acne started to come like clockwork the week before my period - always on my chin. But they weren't *horrible*. They were treatable with the usual benzoyl peroxide and high strength salicylic acid. And it was only the week before my period that I started putting acid on my skin like crazy - salicylic, lactic, at the same time, whatever I had on hand. Then my skin would be flaky, but it would still be no big deal. During these 7 months, I had reverted back to all the old products that I was sure did not make me break out - HABA and The Ordinary. But just reverting back to old products and putting acids on my skin a week per month wasn't enough.

I realized it when the 3 acne cysts all popped up. In a way, they saved my skin.

That's when I realize how terribly clogged my skin was, because I was off birth control. It didn't all of a sudden become ""sensitive"" to new products. It was the oil production causing sebum clogging up my skin that led to these horrible cysts. They probably were looming for a while before I noticed them. So I sat down and thought about how to declog these pores. And I made a resolution to do these 3 things every. single. day.

\- **Oil cleansing**: I couldn't find any literature on how oil cleansers help acne, but anecdotal reports from many people, including those on this subreddit, reassured me enough to try it. I bought a Shu Uemura Ultim8 sublime a while back, but only used it whenever I wore make up that I deemed heavy enough to need an oil cleanser. It was really pleasant to use, but I was just lazy. I now do it every day before putting on night time skin care, without fail. And sure enough, my skin feels so much cleaner without being irritated. Some of the blackheads even loosen over time and fall off with the cleanser!

\- **Exfoliating**: every other day and the week before my period - every day, after oil cleansing with the Shu Uemura, I follow up with the AmorePacific Treatment Enzyme Peel. I've also had this for a long time,  but kind of brushed it aside thinking it was overpriced ineffectiveness when I was only using it twice a week. Now that I use it at least every other day, suddenly my skin seems so much brighter. The exfoliation is gentle and, after getting used to the scent, satisfying. It never dries out my skin.

\- **Salicylic acid**: I know technically this can also fall under exfoliating, but I wanted to give it its own paragraph. I use Paula's 2% BHA, but other 2% BHA products probably would work the same. I actually bought this after the 3 acne cysts popped up, realizing how terribly I needed a daily BHA (I already had her 8% spot treatment, but even that is not enough any more when you have more than 3 pimples all at once...) I now use it twice a day, every day, and it is the product that I remember to use without fail.

I've been doing - if on some day, nothing else - these 3 things consistently, and a period has passed without any pimple popping up on my face. On my jawline, where I don't always apply skin care there as well as my face because I honestly just don't care as much, there are (quite) a few pimples popping up around my period, which means I didn't miraculously have a ""good month"" when my hormones weren't acting out. I didn't have any pimple on my face, because I was diligent, every day, about my skin care.

The 3 acne cysts each took 2 months to go away. Honestly, once they're there, there's nothing short of a cortisone shot that can make them disappear (other than time). But really, they're probably what I needed to tell me to stop being lazy. For some people with good skin (or myself while on birth control), just washing face and putting on the cheapest random drugstore moisturizer would be sufficient to have acne free skin. And then for the rest of us, we just can't.

There's no magic cure for acne. But you may just be able to achieve it, if you take care of your skin every single day. It took me 3 cysts to be reminded of this. I hope it doesn't take you the same amount of pain (ugh).",t3_cev1s8

15,AsianBeauty,"[Discussion] HG Cushion Foundations, Primers, Volumizers and Makeup Fixers?","Hey guys! I want to talk about my favorite type of makeup, complexion! 

I believe Korean Cushions are the best foundations have every tried because a lot of them have given me a super natural look, like my skin but better. I also love how dewy the primers are and I find Volumizers so fun. 

Here are some of my favorite products: 

Moonshot Micro Setting Fit Cushion - I thought I wouldn't like this because I normally like the dewy look, but this cushion has become my HG for summer.  It literally makes me look like I have no makeup on, and it lasts all day. I find the coverage buildable and I just love how it looks like skin on me. Coloring wise, I thought 201 would be too orange on me, but it actually is a bit too fair for me and I might be purchasing 301. 

Pony Effect cushion - Another one of my faves, It makes my skin look so dewy. The shade I got is a bit pale. (I am NW/NC (Yes I have to mix them) 15)  But I love this one. 


Primers : 

I like the dewy look as I mentioned.. however I have only tried two primers. 

VDL Lumilayer Primer - Really like this product, probably won't repurchase. 

Heimeish Artless Glow Base - Not as glowy as I like, but It is a good sunscreen. I use it for when I am not spending a lot of time outdoors. 

Non AB - but I really like Farasali Glass Glow Drops and Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood Flawless Filter as well. 

Volumizer 
Etude House Nymph Glow Aura - Only one I tried, it is good. I find it to be a great dupe for a non AB product, the Kevyn Aucoin Glass Glow Face highlighter. 


Here are some products I want to try that I have on my wishlist on Jolse : 

Cushions: 

moonshot Face Perfection Balm Cushion

CLIO Kill Cover Ampoule Cushion

CLIO Kill Cover Founwear Cushion


Moonflash cushion-  Moonshot

Moonshot Micro Correctfit Cushion

Primer : 

Mamonde Aqua Glow Ball Base 50ml

LANEIGE Glowy Makeup Serum 30ml

31,AsianBeauty,"Houston people! Let's compare notes about the local AB stores, and how do you decide between a relationship with the store, or the lower prices on ebay?","**Ichimaru** has changed up their display again. I've seen one of the Nakeup face cushions, they have the Allie UV sunscreen for 29.99 (about the same as Amazon, but ebay is cheaper). They have some Hada Labo a few dollars more than Amazon prices, an eyelash serum the same marked up price that I've seen on ebay and Amazon.. they have a few kbeauty items. 

*Deals:* After you get 10 points, $20 spend before tax = 1 point, there is a 10% off your next purchase. It seems like there is some kind of membership?

Evidently they have a birthday deal that you get. They seem to have semifrequent posted deals/sales.

&amp;#x200B;

**Japan House** near Seiwa seems to be cheaper generally, with some exceptions than Ichimaru and the selection is different, but a small chuck is the same.

&amp;#x200B;

**Blooming Cosmetics** is... kind of expensive. I feel like the employee that I go to will give me honest opinions and not just try to sell me things. But, these sheet masks that she recommended that I ended up really liking are $28 for 10, Ichimaru has some other ones of that brand on sale $40 for 20 and ebay has it \~$14 for 10. I think the Neogen cleansing pads are $27 or $24 I can't remember. Innisfree items are cheaper elsewhere. The Etude House cat ear hair band is a good price, some of their tools are priced well. Some of the high end kits are sold in sets and the prices aren't too bad I think.. 

Sometimes they get newly released in Korea items-- they got the Laneige Layering cushion fairly early?

I feel like some of their items are fresh, since they get them straight from Korea. If I had to choose between here and Sephora for Laneige, and other items that are the same price at Sephora.. even though I could get that discount at Sephora, I think I'd rather get the Korean version here... Laneige in Korea is a little bit different than the US version. 

The owner remembers me, and she is nice to me. I think that the owner and one of the employees of everyone there will help me find something without just trying to get me to buy something so I appreciate their advice especially since I feel like I haven't figured out how to find the type of advice on here that ends up working for my skin. I get lots of samples. I like O Hui and Phyto vital. They gave me lots of History of Wu spot treatment because I was paranoid about a few spots even though they looked at me like, what spots? You don't need this... But they can be expensive. I'm struggling between continuing to go here and going to ebay. How can I use my loyalty to get lower prices? The owner gave me a discount once on a last-one hair tie. 

*Deals*: After you spend $300 you get $10 back. 

Sometimes when things go on sale, it can be a good price. They had an O Hui cushion buy one get one free (that's 6 packs total for \~$50? can't remember). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Hallyu Cosmetics**: Their prices don't seem too bad. They have smaller brands than Blooming (so it seems to me- the Blooming owner never heard of Goodal when I mentioned the brand). 

I think if you just had surgery on some sort of bone in your face, they can understand (or at least that one girl that one time) that you just had surgery whether or not that was just dental, medically necessary, or cosmetic, they have a good facemask for you. I went looking for eyeliner one day and the advice I got felt like it was coming from a teen who just liked good makeup/skincare and is thinking of something that can do what you're looking for, like a Starbucks barista figuring out how to custom your drink for you when you don't know a clue to what you're doing. 

*Deals*: they seem to have regular sales

&amp;#x200B;

**Aritaum** **(inside H Mart)** feels like Sephora, but they haven't really caught on with new products.

They have the favorite ginger sugar scrub for.. was it the same price as Yesstyle? Or a dollar or two more? Plus you don't need to find $35 to get free shipping or wait a month+ for it... 

*Deals*: their membership feels like Sephora's

Sometimes they have sales and promotions

Pros: my hair feels very soft, I don't have to do a thing to it now for it to look good, just let it air dry and it's like I straightened it

Cons: my hair won't curl anymore..AT ALL, some parts of my hair is a little damaged from the treatment

50,AsianBeauty,"Routine and product advice for fine, dry hair and oily scalps.","My hair is fine and dry, and my scalp is pretty oily. My skin type is also very sensitive so anything with strong fragrances generally don't work with me. I also bleach and colour my hair. I live on the west coast of Canada (weather is very rainy and mild). I find that I still need to wash my hair daily and spray dry shampoo after in order for my hair to look okay throughout the day. This seems like the only routine that helps my hair look semi-decent.  I've read a couple of other posts regarding similar hair, but I am brand new to this and don't use anything outside of my department store shampoo/conditioner and dry shampoo. I've heard of oil cleansing, apple cider vinegar rinses...I just don't know where to start consuming this information. Do I try items one at a time or switch my routine completely?

If you have the same hair type, could you please share why products you use and what your routine for it is? I'm desperate to try a shampoo / conditioner that can help ease the amount of oil on my scalp, hydrate/soften my hair, reduce my usage of dry shampoo unless I want to skip the shower for a day, and won't flare up any skin sensitivities I have? 

I apologize for the newbie questions.",t3_cdnio8

63,AsianBeauty,"[Review] A Review After 6 Months of My Current Skincare Routine (Heimish, Benton, Bellalussi, COSRX, Etude House, The Face Shop)","After 6 months of testing out these products, I wanted to give a review of my experience with my current skin care routine. I have normal skin that can have isolated areas of dryness and minimal CC type acne. 

**Oil Cleanser**: Heimish All Clean Balm - This may be one of my HG products. This oil-based cleanser is so through at removing any trace of makeup on my face, even waterproof mascara. It comes with a cute little spatula for scooping out the balm. It never feels like my face has been stripped after washing it off, my skin always feels hydrated and clean.

**Water Based Cleanser**: Benton Honest Cleansing Foam – After using this, I probably won’t buy another foaming cleanser. Even though the product claims to be a non-tightening formula, my skin always feels stretched after washing off this cleanser.  It also has a pretty heavy fragrance, so it may be irritating on sensitive skin. However, this cleanser does create a very rich foam that feels very nice going on to your skin. 

**Toner**: Etude House Wonder Pore Freshner – I have always had pretty large pores between my eyebrows and on the sides of my nose. I have noticed a visible reduction in my pore size since I have started using this toner. It does feel like a very mild toner (I have used some US made toners that have broken me out before) however it feels very hydrating on my skin. I will usually swipe this toner on to my skin with Pyunkang Yul Cotton Pads and then use the cotton pad as a mini sheet mask on areas where I have larger pores.  

**Sheet Masks**: I have honestly been so all over the place with sheet masks, I don’t even know if I’ve purchased one more than once. I even tried a sheet mask subscription service. I’m still on the hunt for a mask that I want to use consistently. I am looking for one that is moisturizing and works to erase and prevent fine lines and wrinkles. 

**Eyecream**: Bellalussi Ultra Repair Snail Peptide Cream – I just loveee snail products, bring on the muscin. I found this eye cream on Amazon out of desperation after that Mizon eye cream sample I was using ran out. I have to say; I am happy with it. It doesn’t sit on top of my skin or feel sticky. I only have to use the lightest layer for each eye, and it absorbs and really feels like it is working. It does claim to reduce dark circles, but I, for one, haven’t noticed that effect. It also comes in a huge tube as far as eye products go. I feel like I may have trouble using it all up before it expires. 

**Essence**: COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence – If I had to pick one AB product that I couldn’t live without, it would be this one. My skin tends to get very dry and flaky during early spring, I don’t know if it is caused by temperature change or seasonal allergies or what. But I get so self-conscious about my face and I can’t wear makeup over the flaky areas, it just don’t work ya’ll. I found this essence right around the time my skin starts to rebel, I already had some flaky-ness going on when I first started using it. I have had zero problems with dryness since then, my skin always soaks this essence up very quickly and feels bouncy and hydrated. On rare days when I am lazy and abbreviate my routine, this still goes on my face. 

**Mostiurizure**: The Face Shot Mango Seed Silk Moisturizing Lotion – I have to admit; I am pretty meh on this one. The scent is not very mango-y which is disappointing to me because I love mango. The formula is decently creamy but also feels watery if that makes sense… Especially after using the COSRX Power Essence, I feel like I can skip this step most days. I would like to find a different moisturizer that is a little thicker in texture and doesn’t have a fragrance.

**Mask**: I am consistently using the COSRX Nourishing Rice Overnight Mask as the last step in my PM routine. This mask does a great job at sealing in all the products in my routine. My skin always feels silky smooth in the morning when I wash it off. It does have a little bit of a sticky texture when it dries down, so if that kind of thing bothers you, you may not like it. 

I hope you guys enjoyed this review of the products that I have been using for my routine. If you’ve used any of them as well, I would love to hear about your personal experiences.",t3_cd9zca

77,AsianBeauty,[Review] of sorts: Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil for removing grease (read: sunscreen) stains from clothes,"I wear a long-sleeved UPF shirt on a daily basis in the summer, and unfortunately the light-colored polyester fabric really loves to soak up the sunscreen on my neck and hands over time. This leaves dark stains as if the clothing is slightly wet, and the stains barely fade when washed normally with laundry detergent or even when scrubbed with Dawn dish soap.

Fortunately, I've found that cleansing oil (I use Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil, as mentioned in the title) makes short work of these stains, with no scrubbing required. Just saturate the stain with the cleansing oil, and wash as normal with the rest of your laundry. This does require a good amount of oil, since the fabric will actively absorb it, so I would definitely recommend using a cheap cleansing oil (the Softymo is the cheapest per mL that I've found) or one that didn't work out for your face.

This trick seems to work on any kind of oil-based stain, including older ones -- I struggled with the sunscreen stains on my UPF shirt for months before trying the cleansing oil! It also works wonderfully on non-polyester fabrics, including my cotton or cotton+poly shirts and pants. So far I can confirm the effectiveness of Softymo on stains from the following:

* Nivea Strong Fit UV Milky Gel (this has been my daily sunscreen since its release; if there's interest in a separate review I'm happy to write one)
* Anessa Perfect UV Sunscreen Skincare Milk
* Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Milk
* Food grease (sizzling K-BBQ is very tasty but also very messy!)

Anyway, I feel like this was a pretty silly ""review"" to write, but hopefully it helps someone. :)

NB: This post is *not* about the yellow/orange stains left by avobenzone on clothes washed in hard water. While my area does have hard water, I avoid avobenzone sunscreens for exactly that reason and have yet to see any orange staining. Though I suppose it wouldn't hurt to try cleansing oil on those...",t3_ccrtw3

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**General Info (That I got questions about):**

*The reason I typed out some of the ingredient lists is bc I can't find the list in English online that I can easily copy and paste, or the ingredients aren't up to date.*

*I bolded some ingredients that are helpful for skin/skin-identical for healthy skin barrier.*

*The dollar cost is the converted retail price of what it would cost in Korea, without sale/promo.*

*I also looked up all the common plant names from their scientific names because it annoys me when I look at ingredients and I have no idea what that plant is..*

***PEG -*** *something* *means something has been altered or made to be water soluble. It is useful for that but some people avoid it due to microplastics (I don't know a whole lot about it, but have heard people say this).*

[***You don't need to be SUPER DUPER concerned about visible light/blue light protection***](https://labmuffin.com/blue-light-computers-phones-damage-skin/) ***and whatnot, even though some of these products claim to protect against them.***

***TINTED sunscreens are lightly tinted usually in beige or peach color. Peachy shades cancel dark/brown-ish tones (like dark spots, dark undereyes), making skin appear brighter/more awake than normal.***

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**FOR SENSITIVE SKINNED FOLKS ONLY:**

*There is* ***fragrance*** *in the form of natural* ***essential oils*** *and synthetic oils in some of these products. Contrary to popular belief,* **synthetic** ***fragrance*** *isn't worse than essential oils as they can be modified to have less skin-sensitizing components.*

*While fragrance can be* ***perfectly fine*** *for some if you have* ***healthy skin*** *and don't mind the actual smell,* **VERY** ***sensitive*** *skin types may want to* ***avoid it*** *as we don't know exactly what it's made up of. There's another camp that says* ***long term exposure*** *fragrance/essential oils on healthy skin can make it more likely for your skin to* ***develop*** *problems/sensitivity later on. As always,* ***YMMV.***

*Many of these companies* ***claim*** *that their product is the* ***gentlest*** *for the most sensitive skin because of EWG (Environmental Working Group) rating of 1, but* ***EWG is NOT a reliable source, especially for sensitive skinned folks***\*\*, *as they can be very biased and promote skin-sensitizing things just because an ingredient sounds more ""natural"".\** ***Natural*** *things usually contain much more possible* ***skin triggers*** *than lab-isolated,* ***single*** *ingredients.*

&amp;#x200B;

***Potentially Irritating Filters (From Lab Muffin Beauty Science Blog)***

&gt;**Avobenzone** is a common irritant and allergen, so it tends to be unsuitable for sensitive skin, and you’re left with inorganic sunscreens only.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you’re elsewhere in the world, the newer UVA1 filters aren’t particularly irritating or allergenic.  
&gt;  
&gt;A few other organic sunscreens also tend to cause allergic and irritant reactions: **octocrylene, oxybenzone, avobenzone, PABA, Padimate O and enzacamene.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Fragrant oils/extracts:** orange peel essential oil, lavender essential oil

**Potentially problematic things:** Titanium Dioxide alone may not be ideal for some, as it doesn't cover as much of the UV spectrum as other sunscreen agents, particularly UVA.

**Other Info:** 30 Months unopened, 12 months opened, Innisfree suggests writing down the date you opened it/got it on the back of the bottle, due to the lack of more stronger preservatives.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fragrant Oils/Extracts:** Orange extract, grapefruit extract, lemon extract, fragrance

**Potentially problematic ingredients:** **Agar** is used here, possibly as a thickener, but apparently some people break out from algae/seaweed. But it's used in a very small amount. **Royal jelly** does not have substantial studies backing its usefulness in skincare, it may also be an irritant for some (PC). It contains a lot of **ethanol**, the drying alcohol, for those of you who want to avoid it. Alcohol is usually used as a solvent for other ingredients and elegant fast drying effects/enhancing skin penetration.

**Good Things:**

\- Awesome **modern, broad-spectrum** sunscreen filters *(not that others are BAD, the overall formula matters, but for sensitive skinned folks looking for less-irritating chemical filters, the new ones are of interest)*

\- **Hyaluronic acid** &amp; some other things for humectants

\- **Xylitol** provide prebiotic benefits

[**Here's a great breakdown of chemical vs physical sunscreens by Labmuffin**](https://labmuffin.com/chemical-vs-physical-sunscreens-the-science-with-video/)

&amp;#x200B;

**Why are there so many recent products with a lot of essential oils?**

I personally think it's because **essential oils** get a pass rating of ""**1**"" in EWG (Environmental Working Group) but **fragrance** gets an ""**8**"". This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.

There are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.

Some companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.

&amp;#x200B;

**What about preservatives?**

There's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of ""chemicals"", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.

Parabens are actually quite ""natural"" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.

&amp;#x200B;

**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.

**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.

&amp;#x200B;

Antioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.

For your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy &amp; elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**

[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) &amp; How using ""natural"" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.

*P.S. I don't know if I'm going to make any more of these lists bc there isn't that much interest in these sorts of things anyway, generally.*

85,AsianBeauty,SKIPCARE but I stopped using moisturizer?,"I used to use the Nature Republic Aqua moisturizer for combination skin (the green one) and it did the job pretty well, it did moisturize my skin without the excess grease. But for some reason since I started using it, my skin became bumpy and textured. I use the cetaphil gentle cleanser (used since I was 13) with it and my trusty Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner, so it could only mean that it's the one causing my skin to get bumpy. I stopped using it for about 5 days now and my skin became smoother. I ran out of the gentle skin cleanser so I use a foam cleanser now but still use the Pyunkang Yul toner. I use the It's Skin Power Effector VC(?), the yellow one at night after my toner and my routine is done. I don't feel dry, and I haven't had any adverse reaction yet. I know that moisturizer is essential but **is the Pyunkang Yul toner enough for hydrating my skin?** I don't feel like using the moisturizer again or try any new products for fear of breaking out or getting bumpy skin.

P.S. I exfoliate in the morning using the Nivea Baby cream or something like that by massaging it for a minute on my face and then wiping it with a wet towel. I wash with clean water then leave it like that the rest of the day and i never felt dry or greasy - my skin feels comfortable. I don't wash my skin with cleanser in the morning.

Doing skin care for a long time, I feel like I may be doing something wrong by not sticking to the 'essentials,' but I want to scrape off my preconceived notions and believe in my routine since it's working well for me. **I want to know if any of you tried this sort of 'breaking the rules' routine and how it worked for you.**",t3_ccr6d8

87,AsianBeauty,Reviews of All the AB Products/Brands I Have Tried,"My skin type: oily, semi acne-prone, sensitive to scarring 

I have tried a lot of AB products since my skin started to have cc's, acne, scars, sign of dullness (shout out to my P.E teacher for all the time my class had to run in the sun for 45 minutes and my dumbass thinking sunscreen was a waste of time) 

// all of these reviews are my personal opinions and please remember that products work differently for everyone. I am not a professor of skin care ingredients, I just want to share my own experience of products I used (long post) //

[ **COSRX**]

• **AHA WHITEHEAD LIQUID**: I have seen so much hype for this products, and I looked forward to this product getting rid of my whiteheads or smoothing my skin with its AHA. It did nothing for me, I kept trying to use it hoping something would happen but I saw no improvement. I'd leave it on my skin for 3 hours after school everyday, it just felt like a left  a watery lotion layer on my skin and that is it. 

• **BHA BLACKHEAD LIQUID**: Again, same hype I saw, same expectation I had, same experience. If there's anything I can give credit for,  I'd say it absorbs well/fast though I saw no results using it. My blackheads on the nose weren't improved, it felt like an unnecessary skin care step for me. 

• **Rice Sleeping Mask**: I absolutely loved it! Though I stopped using it since my skin grew other concerns than dullness. This sleeping mark absorbs fast and left my skin hydrated, but it got a bit oily after a while. For a product you can find under $14,  this product does what it promises. Just don't expect it to leave your skin dewy, instant bright etc. 

• **AC COLLECTION SPOT TREATMENT**: HG!!!! I CAN'T SHOW ENOUGH LOVE FOR THIS. I purchased it when I was stressed with exams, got random pimples on my cheeks every now and then and of course, the scars of past acnes. The product lasts for a long time and doesn't irritate my skin. It actually helps my acnes to dry up within 3-5 days and the acnes tend to leave no scars. 

• **ACNE PIMPLE MASTER PATCH**: I can't say much about it except that it works. Though it only works for acnes that already show heads, I wouldn't consider it a HG. It didn't (magically) smoothen then calm the acne spot as it was advertised. 

• **SNAIL 96 MUCCIN POWER ESSENCE**: I knew this product got a lot of love on this sub Reddit but I couldn't bring myself to love it. It felt sticky, wouldn't absorb at all which made it harder for me to apply the left of my skin care routine. I gave up on it after 2 week of use. 

[ **LANEIGE ]

• **WATER SLEEPING MASK**:  HG! I am on my 4th bottle right now. It's soooo soothing and hydrating. It absorbs into my skin the moment I pat, leaving my skin matte. It's easily found on Amazon or eBay for &lt;$18. It does have fragrance but I'm not bothered by it, it smells fresh actually. My skin is always brightened in the morning and soft after using this sleeping mask. 

[ **INNISFREE ]

• **TANGERINE VITA C CREAM**:  I recently grew a huge obsession with vitamin C. I know this product isn't popular, most don't even know it existed. And honesty, most don't know about it because IT ABSOLUTELY DID NOTHING. Citrus smell, gel-like texture, absorbs nicely, but did absolutely nothing besides drying my skin after 30 mins of application

• **MINERAL OIL FREE CUSHION**: I love it! It has a mint-y feel after you apply it, keep the oil under control for &lt;3 hours. 

• **PORE WHITENING SLEEPING MASK**: Like I said, I was obsessed with Vitamin C. This sleeping mask comes in a huge bottle (100mL), I'm currently still using it. It absorbs well only if you spend 60 seconds patting it, though it does brighten my scars and skin tone, doesn't cause acne or irritation. 

• **PORE WHITENING SERUM**: The texture of this serum was exactly like its sleeping mask. I hated it. I foam up on my skin, made it impossible to apply the next product without leaving a mess. 

• **JEJU ORGANICE GREEN TEA SEED SERUM** : I don't hate it or nor love it. I only use it once in a while when I'm bored to be frank. It doesn't really help much with anything, maybe a little bit of hydration? I find it to stay on the skin rather than absorbing in. I expected it to soothe my redness after I went out in the sun, but again, like I said, it didn't do much. 

[ **SKIN&amp;LAB**]

• **RED SERUM**:  I was intrigued by the name, looked up the info and found the product to contain many new ingredients and source of Vitamin C. It offered to brighten up your skin, anti-aging,  and moisturize. It has kind of a weird scent, very light,  absorbs easily and so far I see my skin getting that glow using it without any acnes or irritation. 

[ **ETUDE HOUSE** ] 

• **TONING WHITE C TONE UP CREAM**:  Gel-like texture, keeps my oil under control better than most tone up creams I have used. It doesn't really moisturize well though it does tone up the skin, doesn't cause acne. The toneup doesn't really has the glow effect I expect but it's a fine product. I'll use it for longer to see if it brightens up skin tone overall other than just toning up. 

• **TONING WHITE C SLEEPING MASK**:  The texture is super familiar with the Innisfree Pore Whitening Sleeping Mask. Absorbs nicely, has a fresh lemon smell. My face doesn't feel oily after using it, I sort of love it. It's light and perfect for the summer use. 

• **MY LASH SERUM**:  I have only started using it for 2 weeks but I have noticed my lashes getting curlier and my lower lashes are a tad longer. Kind of shocked(?). It works so well for a product under $5

• **VITA C TALK GEL CREAM**:  Lightweight, but definitely doesn't do anything besides hydrating. It's not bad, but when I bought a Vitamin C product I really expect it to brighten my skin rather than just hydrating. 

•**ETUDE HOUSE MOISTFUL COLLAGEN CREAM**:  My skin is responsive to it, it leaves my skin moisturized the second it's tapped. A tiny bit of product is enough to cover my face. An amazing moisturizer for such a price imo. Isn't outstanding but if you're just looking for an affordable product to moisturize, this is it

[**TONY MOLY*"" ]

• **Vita 12 Synergy Cream**: Absolutely hate it. It has a yellow-ish color and smells awful. It gave me bad break-out and I couldn't find myself wanting to touch that product again after a week of use. 

• **GREEN VITA C SPARKLING SERUM**: I think this is the only product I have found of Tony Moly that doesn't contain unbearable fragrance. My skin likes it, not necessarily love it. Does it absorb? Yes. Does it reduce acne scar appearance? Yes. But it feels oily, not extremely but I couldn't stand it when my face feels like an oily pan. 

[ **GLOW RECIPE** ]

• **WATERMELON SLEEPING MASK**: OMG GUYS I CAN'T LOVE THIS ENOUGH! Put aside the fact that you have to mix it every 2 nights so the texture isn't separated, it gives me such a good glow. I have felt in love with this and thought this was the only good product worth spending $45 for. It takes care of my acnes scar, brighten my skin, feel amazing on my skin. Definitely helped with my most concerns: acne and dullness

• **WATERMELON PINK JUICE MOISTURIZER**: I wanted to love it, I really did but the texture of this moisturizer never absorbed on my skin. It even made my skin oilier. Such huge disappointment. 

• **SWEET CHEF BEET + VITAMIN A SERUM**:  I found this art Target,  was intrigued since Glow Recipe made this. It does leave me a glowy look after the first use but it's so hard to take the product to use that I couldn't be bothered to continue using it. If they ever make this product easier to come out I'll definitely repurchase


• **SWEET CHEF KALE + VITAMIN B SERUM**: It's meant for dry skin, I bought it out of curiousity though of course my skin hated it. Couldn't absorb, texture is too thick for a serum. 

• **SWEET CHEF GINGER + VITAMIN C SERUM**: The only product my skin lives for out of three. Not an ordinary Vitamin C Serum but it's cheap and easy to find for me, it does what vitamin C suppose to do. My skin tone is so responsive to it! 

[ **ROHTO** ]

**MELANO CC ESSENCE SPOT TREATMENT**: I used it a couple times but stopped when I had too much Vitamin C related skin care. I surprisingly reduced my acne appearance after the first use I was shook honestly. But I didn't like the idea of using tube personally, it just felt tiring squeezing it on my finger for but. I knew it help the product to not be oxidized but definitely not my cup of tea. The product overall was amazing. 

[ **NEOGEN**] 

**VITAMIN C SERUM**: It contains 22% of vitamin C + Niacinamide so I was afraid it would be too irritating. The result was opposite of what I expected, HG! Absorbs easily with a couple pats, doesn't have fragrance and my skin has never been more pleased. It faded my super old acne scars that my other products couldn't. I really recommend everyone to give it a look if you're looking for a new Vitamin C serum. 

[ **KLAIRS** ]

• **FRESHLY JUICED VITAMIN E MASK**:  The texture is weird, and really hard to apply imo. It also contains cica kind of smell. I tried to use it at the end of my routine but the texture if its just ended up make my serums a mess (it foamed up) 

• **FRESHLY JUICED VITAMIN C**:  Contains only 5% vitamin C. It's gentle but not my cup of tea. I think it's good for sensitive skin people but for me, I didn't see any result using it. The white glass of this product gave me anxiety as well as it made the product oxidize easier.",t3_ccbm0y

89,AsianBeauty,[Review] Etude House Soon Jung Line,"My skintype: highly sensitive, acne-prone, oily dehydrated skin.

Environment: humid all year round in Malaysia. 

WNR - would not repurchase

MRP - might repurchase

HG - holy grail

*= broke out my sensitive skin but did show some effects, so it might work for you

*pH 5.5 Relief Toner*

WNR - This is a HG for many people, its sad it couldnt make it to my HG list. This toner doesn’t really hydrate my dry skin, it feels oily and it pills on top of my skin instead of hydrating. I would rather go back to my Hada Labo Light toner to properly hydrate my skin. 

*10 Free Moist Emulsion* 

MRP - I love how the emulsion doesn’t pills on my skin compared to other emulsions normally does on me. Absorbs well, actually pretty moisturizing on its own. Doesn’t leave any irritation on me, which is a bonus. 

*2x Barrier Intensive Cream*

MRP - I have been looking for a decent moisturiser that won’t cause any breakouts on my sensitive acne prone skin and I think I finally found it. I don’t feel it moisturize my face better than my TO squalane oil, however I would consider repurchasing this in case I can’t get my hands on my squalane oil any time soon. 

*5 Panthensoside Cica Balm*

MRP - This cica balm is a HG for some people too, saying it helped their skin tremendously. I bought this balm expecting it to perform like it claim, to reduce redness and shrink acne. I have been using this for several weeks, but I don’t see any improvements on my redness nor my acne. Yes, this balm has a soothing effect but it doesn’t really improve anything else besides just soothing the skin. Bonus to this for not causing me any breakouts. 


*Pros* : 
- doesn’t cause any breakouts 
- suitable for sensitive skin 
- does soothe the skin

*Cons*: 
- doesn’t help improve redness or acne
- not very hydrating for dehydrated skin",t3_ccd1it

&amp;#x200B;

As we all know, sunscreen is the most essential step in our skincare routine.

I'm constantly buying and trying new sunscreens because I have nothing better to do with my time.

Skin Type: Combination (Oily T-Zone, normal everywhere else) / Acne-prone

&amp;#x200B;

\- **A'pieu Power Block Aqua Sun Gel SPF 50+ PA++++**

This is so good, it has a semi-matte finish, no white-cast and feels very hydrating.

Easy to spread, easy to re-apply, kept my t-zone less oily, what more could you want? Oh and it's 8$ for 50ml.

*Filters*: **Homosalate**, **Avobenzone**, **Tinosorb S**, **Octocrylene**

&amp;#x200B;

\- **Missha Aqua Sun Gel SPF 50+ PA++++**

Very similar in texture to the A'pieu one, but I think this one might've clogged my pores. Still used it up because it was also really really good. This one also has a minor mattifying effect. It also costs \~8$ for 50ml.

*Filters:* **Homosalate**, **Avobenzone**, **Tinosorb S**, **Octocrylene**

&amp;#x200B;

\- **Canmake Mermaid Skin UV Gel SPF SPF 50+ PA++++**

This one is very popular in this sub, everyone here praises it and loves it. I'm not here to dethrone it, everything that's been said about this one is true; fragrance-free, white-cast free, alcohol free, all the bad things. It spreads beautifully, it makes your skin glow. BUT, it's expensive. 12.50$ for 40ml is too much for me.

*Filters:* **Octinoxate, Uvinul A Plus, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Tinosorb S**

&amp;#x200B;

\- **Biore Aqua Rich UV Essence 2019 SPF 50+ PA++++**

The cult-favorite sunscreen, the holy grail, the magical sunscreen that solves all of your problems.

Nope.

We've all heard of this sunscreen, we've all tried it or have wanted to try it, well I'd tell you, skip the 2019 one. I have previously tried the 2017 formulation and it was great, it didn't feel like anything, absorbed easily, just overall perfect. But this one, oh honey, no. They went somewhere wrong with the formula because this one leaves a disgusting sticky residue on my skin and aggravates my oil production. The only positive thing about this sunscreen is that it makes my skin glow.

If you have oily skin, do not get this. Maybe it works for dry/normal skinned folks, but my oily friends - you will regret purchasing this one.

*Filters:* **Octinoxate, Tinosorb S, Uvinal A Plus**

&amp;#x200B;

\- **Balea Sundance Sensitiv Sonnenfluid SPF 50**

The only european sunscreen in this review. It has an amazing texture, really hydrating, no bad ingredients, but, it certainly does have a white-cast that doesn't fade. I use this as a body sunscreen.

*Filters:* **Uvinal A Plus, Titanium Dioxide (Nano), Ensulizole**

&amp;#x200B;

\- **Innisfree Triple Care SPF 50+ PA++++**

The worst white-cast I've ever experienced, absolutely disgusting smell and made people think I had some disease because it made me that pale. Do not get this.

*Filters:* ***Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide***",t3_cc9wgt
92,AsianBeauty,Sun sticks or sun cushion? Which do you prefer and why?,"I'm debating how I should go about reapplying sunscreen. There are some pros and cons that I've gathered so far.

Sun sticks:

Pro - convenient and easy to wipe off bacteria with alcohol wipe

Con - may be harder to get around crevices, like the nose and eye area. Weirder to apply a deodorant-like stick onto your face in public (say on a train or bus)


Sun cushions: so I plan on not refilling a sponge for hygienic reasons and also to avoid the sun screen going bad (you risk exposing it to air more frequently after pouring it into a cushion, i.e. liquid sunscreen wasn't formulated to last in this condition/outside the tube). I plan on just keeping an empty cushion case with the blender and just carry around the tube of sunscreen then apply as needed. This also saves on product waste since I won't be soaking a sponge with the sunscreen. 

Pros - convenient, will have a mirror on the go, will be able to reach crevices on the face like the eye and nose. 

Cons - sponges tend to accumulate bacteria and grime more often which is what's steering me away from using this method.",t3_cce3us

98,AsianBeauty,Korean Vacation Haul + Review~,"I went on a trip to Korea a few weeks ago and was meaning to review these products sooner, but ended up taking a vacation to Thailand too! So I'll throw in a review for the few products I bought there too.

Background: I have very fair, combo/dry skin, live in a humid climate, and have lots of hyperpigmentation, scarring, and hormonal acne.

**Peripera Ink Skin Tint in #1 Ivory - 5/5**

I absolutely love this foundation, it's a really fair price, about 9000 won and it's perfect for the light days where I want very little coverage. Which is pretty much everyday...I'm comfortable with my skin for the most part, and I love how it shows my summer freckles. The shade range is awful, but it's so light that it almost doesn't matter. The shade is almost too light for me right now, but I suspect in the winter it will be a dead on match. When I don't want to use my trusty laneige cushion, this is what I have been reaching for to feel a little more put together.

&amp;#x200B;

**3CE Heart Pot Lip in #Woody Rose - 4.5/5**

I went into Stylenanda expecting not to get anything, but this caught my attention. It's a travel sized lip pot with a little mirror and everything and it's got the cutest packaging. If I recall correctly it was about 6000 won, so not too expensive for 3CE. And let me tell you, I love the colour so much. It's the most perfect, disney princess, rosebud, but still natural look. This is what I wear when I want to look natural, but want that soft red to contrast with my features. The reason it's not a full 5 stars is that it's not particularly long wearing, but I still love it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Innisfree my blush in #5 - 5/5**

I'm not going to lie, I got this as a free gift for the obscene amount of money I spent at innisfree buying backups of my HG moisturizer, the innisfree green tea seed cream. I would have never picked this shade out, but it's my favorite thing I got. It's a beautiful, rosy brown that is the exact shade that my skin blushes. It genuinely looks like I was just caught in the sun, and it lasts very well, I'm so glad that I got it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Innisfree Smart Drawing Blusher in 01 - 4/5**

I had super high expectations for this blush, it came highly recommended and was even compared to the Glossier cloud paints (non-ab), one of my favorite cream blushes. This is really good! I love the scent, the color is a bit light, but still really natural and pretty. But my main issue is the applicator, like the cloud paints, I always feel like I'm wasting product and ultimately, money. I do like it though, and would like to try some different colors because the formula is super nice and cooling.

&amp;#x200B;

**VT Cosmetics BT21 Lipstick in 01 (Shooky) - 5/5**

Let me be honest, I only bought this because I stan BTS. Yoongi, the man who created shooky, isn't even my bias (though I do adore him), but I was pleasantly surprised by this lipstick. The formula is good, nothing particularly special, it's a nice, creamy lipstick with a satin matte finish. But what surprised me was the beautiful colour of this lipstick. It's a perfect, rosy browny nude that can go with literally any look I wear. It's not too cool, it's not too warm, it just makes my lips look soft and plush and not unlike a disney princess'. It's my new go to shade and I love it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Peripera ASMR Lip Balm in #1 - 2/5**

I've been searching for the perfect baby pink lipstick, one that would be sweet and nice, without pulling too Barbie dreamhouse on me. I picked this up with high hopes, but unfortunately it's not quite the right shade on me. I prefer more muted tones, and it's just a hair too bright. The formula isn't awesome, it's a bit gloopy, and I don't like that I can't twist down. I think I'm going to donate it to a friend because it's just not doing it for me.

&amp;#x200B;

**Peripera Airy Ink Velvet in 05 Genius Rosy Pink - 4.5/5**

I do have another peripera ink tint in the original formula, and I love it! But I saw this on sale at olive young and I think I like this one even more. It's a gorgeous pink, with a finish that makes your lips look pillowy. But I don't like it best on it's own. I think that it works better as a sort of ""inner lip"" finisher or blotted.  It lasts pretty well, and I really like it. The .5 is docked because I wish it was just a bit softer.

&amp;#x200B;

**Peripera Sugar Twinkle Liquid Eyeshadow in #12 - 5/5**

I bought this in hopes that it would satisfy my want for the Stila liquid shadows, and boy did this do the job. It is the most beautiful sparkle, that can be built up, or blended out in a sheer wash of sparkle that just catches the light. I can't speak to all the shades, but I love this so much.

&amp;#x200B;

\~Bonus Thai Products\~

**4u2 Heart Me Cream Blush in Sweet as You - 3/5**

To be honest, not my favorite cream blush formula. The color is amazing, but it's too matte for my tastes. I want to play around with it more to see if I can try applying it with a brush or sponge to see if I can make it work for me. It's got such cute packaging and is a wonderful brown/red.

&amp;#x200B;

**4u2 Hello Kitty Mousse Tint in Peach- 3/5**

I bought this because of packaging and the pretty peach color. But the formula is not a mousse, it's just a liquid lipstick and it doesn't particularly smell good. I'm not so into liquid lipstick anymore, and this formula isn't quite what I look for anymore. I'm going to play around with different gloss combos and pairing it with other lipsticks that I like, but if I don't end up liking it, I'll give it to a friend.

101,AsianBeauty,[Review] SOS: Save Our Skin – Mediheal P.D.F. AC- Defense Nude Gel Mask,"[This mask yall.](https://www.masksheets.com/p-d-f-ac-defense-nude-gel-mask-g.html)

&amp;#x200B;

[Mediheal P.D.F. A.C.–Defense Hydro Nude Gel Mask. It's a mouthful, and I don't know what any of those acronyms mean.](https://i.redd.it/cte9of4nrs931.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

So when I first opened this I was caught a little off guard, because I'd bought it without knowing that it was a gel mask. The plastic guard and the mask itself are both clear so I literally thought I'd bought a defective one that was missing its mask lol.

When I saw this in the store, I just read the words ""pore refining/sebum control"" and instantly I was SOLD. Usually I shouldn't believe everything on the packaging but I guess I lucked out because it did everything it claimed it would do and more.

&amp;#x200B;

I paid 4000 won at Olive Young, and for the quality of this thing, it's a damn steal. Of course, if I wanted to make this a regular and use it every week, it'd add up but STILL. Compared to some of those pricy ampoule masks out there, it's the next best thing.

&amp;#x200B;

As you might have guessed, I have intensely oily skin, and because my skin thinks it's such a great idea to pump out enough sebum to grease a pan, I also have intensely big pores, and my past acne scarring makes some of them look like they're permanently open, like a pothole in my face.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd been pretty lazy in terms of skincare and decided that today would be the ""revamp day."" I went all out. I wish I had the diligence to do this every day lol.

Here is what I used besides the mask, and what probably helped make sure it worked.

1. Oil Cleanse: Erno Laszlo Phelityl Oil
2. La Roche Posay Effaclar Gel Cleanser for Oily Skin
3. Mario Badescu Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs, and Rosewater
4. Mediheal P.D.F. A.C.– Defense Hydro Nude Gel Mask
5. TheFaceShop Dr. Belmeur Cica Peptite Ampoule

The mask comes in two parts, for the top and bottom half of the face. This makes customizing the size to different face shapes easier and because it's a gel, it sticks to your face so well, but it does not leave a sticky residue.

I really should've taken a before/after photo but I didn't expect this mask to show results so immediately – I thought it was one of those that I had to use consistently to start seeing differences but my pores looked visibly tightened, and my face looked more plump. Most of all, my skin looked *clean.* Usually when I start putting face products after washing my face, I feel as if some of the products that I use don't absorb all the way and leave my pores looking just as big as before washing. But my face looked satisfyingly clear.

I do admit I left it on for longer than advised, but by the time I went to take it off, my skin had basically sucked the moisture out of the gel sheet.

Although I am one to finish my skin routine AT the sheet mask on the days I use them, the juice from the gel mask had absorbed so freakin well that I thought I'd put an extra step that would provide a good barrier for my skin as I went to bed.

&amp;#x200B;

This mask is one of those I'd recommend to use before going out, a date, an important event, or on days you just want to look good because of how supple it leaves the skin, it'd be a good primer for base makeup.

**Overall:**

* Mask is a two gel sheets that can fit on any face
* The gel nature of the sheet makes the skin really absorb the mask serum
* Does not leave the face with excess serum on the face, pores noticeably tighter
* Sebum-controlling component make this mask a good primer before base makeup, can be a daytime mask acting as a foundation primer that can also protect skin from pollution, dust, etc.
* Face should be especially well-cleansed before using mask to ensure getting the most out of it.
* Mask serum is lighter than how it feels on the hands – highly buildable on top, whether it be ampoules or creams.
* Would recommend storing in fridge before use. Face feels plumper and it just feels good to have your face suck on a cold, slimy, gel sheet.
* Would take caution when taking the plastic guard off the mask – the mask was pretty slippery when it came out it was a bit difficult to separate the plastic layer from the gel layer. The sheet for the upper face has TWO plastic guards on each side... that confused me a little bit,",t3_cc65ny
102,AsianBeauty,Missha Time Revolution Artemisia Treatment Essence!,"If you’re suffering from extreme irritation or Rosacea this will be your new best friend. Mugwort is anti-fungal, anti-inflammatory, rich in vitamin A, E, C, Non-comedogenic, and all around a great soothing ingredient.

For reference here’s my skin a day apart when I first used it. (The first photo is after, the second photo is before)  You can really see how much it calmed down my redness. (possibly mild rosacea). Of course do patch test because what works for me might not work for you.

Texture: 💧 

This baby has the texture of water, and you can layer with without a problem. If you get a little too zealous like I was, it can get sticky, but it wasn’t anything too unbearable. The finish of this is super pretty too it dries down to a smooth satin glow without looking oily. If you’re someone who doesn’t like to put a lot of skincare on in the AM I feel like this would work really well under makeup. 

Scent: 💐

Usually all my skincare is fragrance free and essential oil free so I don’t really get to enjoy the scent of products. I either get bland boring lotion or chemicals. Neither an attractive scent. I’m also that fun person who can smell you wearing your Victoria Secret perfume a mile away— and yes I will get a headache from it. So I need something non offensive. This straight up smells like an apple pie. I had to double check the ingredients to make sure they didn’t had fragrance. It smells SO good. I had to stop myself from wanting to eat it a few times. I looked like a crazy person sniffing my hands after applying it because it smelled so good.

Effects: 🌿

This instantly calmed down all my redness in a matter of minutes. When my skin is at its most sensitive I notice just how much cooler and less red my face looks. My overall skin looks much healthier, and my skin looks and feels softer.

Overall Thoughts: 💭 

Not to be overdramatic, but I would die for this. I’ve been into AB for three years, and I can say truly without a doubt this is THE only product that hasn’t irritated my skin. I’m dying to try the I’M From essence, but unless that beats this one the Missha Essence is my HG. I really wished I had mugwort essence when I first started AB three years ago.",t3_cc0cbh

106,AsianBeauty,[Review] Rohto Skin Aqua UV Moisture Milk.. Possible Holy Grail,"For a while I have been on a search for sunscreens that don’t have whitecast and are also waterproof (I sweat easily and it’d be a waste to sweat off sun protection 10 mins after going outside) and saw a lot of positive feedback for this sunscreen. I am also caramel skinned so having little to no whitecast is important to me, no one wants to look pasty.

I had previously bought a sunscreen by Neutrogena that was SPF 100+ and was super disappointed, in store the whitecast seemed minimal but applied it was terrible, thats when I realized I needed to investigate into better sunscreen and decided to try an AB brand. I decided on this one because it was waterproof as well which is very important to me.

I have been using it about a week and I really love it!! It is thin and not pasty like American sunscreens, glides on very easily. It is a little oily if you use a lot but rubbed into skin is no different than a good moisurizer, definitely gives you some glow as opposed to washing you out. It has no whitecast when rubbed in so it is definitely suitable for brown skin and maybe even darker. I have also used it before working out outside and when sweating you can see a little whitecast but wiped away is almost nothing. It is also 100% better than what has happened to me when using an American sunscreen.

I’m really liking it and would definitely rebuy. I got mine off of ebay for about 15, it is the newest 2019 edition of this sunscreen. The only negative is the bottle is small for price but to me definitely worth it for how good it is and pretty affordable for the benefit. I also really like that the applicator is small, I just draw lines on my face with the bottle and rub it in as opposed to squirting some on your hands like lotion and applying it that way like I was doing before. 

If you are tan/darker skinned and looking for waterproof sunscreen or no whitecast I definitely recommend trying it.",t3_cc07yi

112,AsianBeauty,[Guide] A Really short introduction to Asian Beauty for newbies.,"## What's Asian Beauty (AB)? 

Cosmetics from Asia. Simple as that. 

## Will Asian cosmetics be better for my skin? 

That depends on your needs and concerns. The industry is somewhat different, but the products themselves aren't exactly groundbreaking or special compared to western options. Just think of it as widening your shopping options.

## What's my skin type? How do I find it? Why does it matter?

Generally you want to assess your skin type when it's completely bare. Wash with water, and then try to see how it responds. 

* **Oily** - Your skin produces sebum fairly quickly, enough for it to get visible in a short time. 
* **Dry** - Your skin products little to no sebum, or takes too long to do so, thus making your face feel dry. Often sensitive.  
* **Combination** - Only your nose and forehead (T-Zone) gets oily.
* **Normal** - Your skin feels fine as it is. 

Skin types aren't permanent, it depends on other aspects such as the state of your hormones or even the climate you reside in. Some people see shifts in their skin based on weather or even indoor temperatures. 

Knowing your skin type is important because you want to build a skincare routine around it. If your routine doesn't fit you, then you're likely to cause more problems to yourself. 

## What kind of products are out there? 

1. **Cleanser** - To clean your face with. There are generally two types of cleansers that are mentioned: Surfactant based (Example: Soap) and Oil based (Oils are good at breaking down things, hence why it's used as a cleanser). 
2. **Toner / Skin / Lotion** - A light watery product with the goal to hydrate your skin. 
3. **Essence / Serum / Ampoule** - Products with the goal of providing a higher concentration of a specific ingredient. 
4. **Moisturizing Cream / Moisturizing Gel / Emulsion** - Moisturizers
5. **Sunscreen** - To protect from the sun. SPF refers to UVB protection. PA/PPD refers to UVA protection.  
6. **Sleeping Masks / Occlusives** - Product with the goal of trapping moisture underneath it. 
7. **Wash Off Masks / Sheet Masks** 

There are other product types, but for the sake of clarity and being a beginner guide it's best to just have these in mind. 

### Do I need to use all of these products? 

No. Routines are individual and personal. Do what's comfortable for you. 

As an example here are some (not all) reasons why you may not need certain products: 

* Some oily skinned people may not want moisturizers at all and use only a Toner / Skin / Lotion. 
* Essence / Serum / Ampoule aren't the only product types with a concentration of an ingredient. You can find plenty of ingredient focus moisturizers or even toners. 
* Some people tend to feel more dryer with a cleanser, and simply washing their face with water. 

### What's the most core routine? 

1. Cleanser
2. Moisturizer 
3. Sunscreen 

### Do these products have to be used in a specific order? 

No. Go lightest to heaviest as a general guide. Main exceptions are: 

* **Sunscreen**: Should always be last in the morning.  
* **Occlusives / Sleeping Masks**: Should be last at night. 

### Are there products more important than others? 

This is a pretty personal question. While some may immediately respond 'sunscreen', there may be those who lead a life with little to no sun exposure: Working late night shifts, living somewhere where the sun isn't up much, etc. What's most important depends entirely on your skin and your needs. 

## Is there anything else I need to know? 

Naturally, like many other things, there is a lot more information than presented. But trying to consume it all as a newbie will do you no good and only complicate things for absolutely no reason. Some things are more advanced with reason, and it would be a bit risky to do anything with the more advanced steps without even understanding the basics.",t3_cbsl4b

127,AsianBeauty,[REVIEW] HOLIKA HOLIKA MAKE UP SUN CREAM 60ML - AWFUL EXPERIENCE WITH SMELL,"Hello everyone,  
I just received my order of the Holika Holika Make up sun cream 60 ML (PA+++ SPF 50+). Here is my review:  
\- **Texture : 10/10 :** It's not too thick or too runny, its texture is a bit similar to the Skin Aqua Tone up UV Essence / A'pieu Madecassoside Sun Cream   
\- **Sun protection :** Physical filter (Zinc Oxide, info from CosDNA.com, although I'm not sure what % ), good for sensitive skin. I have been wearing it for 4 hours and so far no allergy, no burns  
\- **SMELL : 0/10 .** The smell is floral and nice, and I have no problem with a little fragrance from time to time, but the smell LINGERS AFTER 4 HOURS OF WEAR JUST LIKE A PERSISTENT EX.  It made my nose really sensitive and stuffed, and I had to wipe off the sunscreen patch in front of my nose.  


If you do not want a stuffed nose, or you simply hate fragrance in your cosmetics, AVOID THIS PRODUCT ASAP.

129,AsianBeauty,[Review] Pigeon UV Baby Milk Waterproof SPF 50+ PA++++,"&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/vilsg9tn2e931.jpg

Haven't seen a review for this sunscreen yet so thought I'd post! This sunscreen uses physical filters only (zinc &amp; titanium dioxide), is unscented, no alcohol, no parabens. See [ingredients](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/pigeon-uv-baby-milk-waterproof-spf50/) at Ratzilla.

I've used this sunscreen consistently \~ 2 weeks now, so got a pretty good feel for it. I've used almost exclusively Japanese sunscreen since 2016, but recently with my raging hormones, I wanted to be safe and use products for sensitive skin. Also curious about Japanese physical sunscreen and wondered if they're better than my horrible experience with the Cerave one (which surprised me as their other skincare products minus sunscreen are solid). Well, surprisingly (or I guess not, considering the Japanese skincare market is brutal), it's much, much better.

**Application**: applies nicely without that really sticky feel of physical sunscreen (but then, my only reference is Cerave so maybe you won't be as pleasantly surprised as me). It **DOES** leave a white cast on my skin (Asian, about NC20-NC25), but disappears nicely after \~10 mins or so (works for me, that's when I start driving and start to put on my foundation - please don't report me to highway patrol :( ). **Unscented**.

**Feel**: throughout the day, it is not greasy, which is a plus for my combo skin. I've tried to experiment with layering just a moisturizing toner (Japanese lotion) beneath it, and by the time I put on my matte foundation, my skin feels pretty matte, bordering dry. If I use a moisturizing toner, then light emulsion, then the Pigeon and matte foundation, it's perfect. I'd say if you have oily skin but don't use foundation, or use a dewy foundation, you may be able to get away with just a moisturizing toner. If you have dry skin, this one may be a tough sell - you'll probably have to layer quite a bit of hydration, as this sunscreen adds none.

**Effectiveness**: well, I've worn it exclusively for two weeks and within this time frame, my skin has gotten brighter (from other products - not the sunscreen, but that means it does what it claims to do). So I guess it works. It is truly waterproof - even after a 10 hr work day, when I come back and splash water on my face, it is still there and I can see the round water droplets roll down my face nicely - so yay, waterproof as it claims. I do use an oil cleanser on days I use it, as I'm doubtful just my Glossier jelly cleanser can get this baby off.

**Overall:** It's not exciting, but it gets the job done. Solid option for those with sensitive skin and want to try a physical sunscreen. It won't be as elegant as your chemical ones, but pleasant enough. Added this to the repertoire of my safe stash that I can always go back to if my skin decides to go full-blown crazy again. Regarding other physical sunscreens, I remember trying the Shigaisen Yohou in a store, and the application of that one felt much nicer, but it's also more expensive. If you have dry skin though, I feel like that's a better choice.

**Price**: I bought in on US Amazon for $13, which surprisingly is NOT tripled the Japanese retail price. Shocking.",t3_cbauns

139,AsianBeauty,[Discussion] Does anyone feel a bit self conscious about their pale skin due to avoiding sunlight?,"I can't be the only one that feels this. I'm an Asian male (mid 20s) who got obsessed with skin care after I had gotten moderate acne back in high school. Ever since then I've been avoiding the sun due to the fear of making my hyper-pigmented spots from acne even darker or worsening them. As a result I am pale as a vampire. Porcelain in colour. I know some of you might think, ""that's the skin colour I want"", that's fine, but as a guy, I can't help but feel less masculine, especially when I'm around my other male Asian friends who are all tan.

Being this pale has taken a toll on my confidence somewhat as I feel like I would get labelled. Labelled as in, some might think I'm a FOB (fresh off the boat) or someone who doesn't go outside. My relatives tell me I need to get a tan to get some colour in me/ I don't look healthy (even though I'm perfectly healthy). I can't be the only one that feels this. 

I look back at photos before I got acne, enjoying life in the sun and not caring about protecting it (while avoiding getting sun burnt). I looked healthier with that golden glow in my opinion. So here's a question, to what extent of sun exposure can it cause ageing in the long run/ wrinkles? I look at my sisters skin (shes mid 20s) and she doesn't care about avoiding/ protecting her skin as much yet her skin looks perfectly youthful with no wrinkles, no spots, not dry looking. Shes darker than I am because of sunlight. I want to get to that freedom again but also limiting myself.",t3_cbbo33

148,AsianBeauty,[Journal] 10 Year Skin Progress,"Hi everyone! This is my first post so let me know if I need to adjust or edit anything!

I wanted to share my 10 year skincare journey starting from when I was around 10-12 years old. It has been long and hectic but I have finally reached a point where I feel comfortable with my skin. I have shed many tears and experienced moments of intense frustration and self-hatred. I hope someone can listen to my story and regain hope :)

Skin type: Combination, acne-prone (especially T-zone), sensitive

After I hit puberty, my skin slowly became worse and worse. As an Asian girl, whose friends mostly had clear or clearer skin, this shattered my self-esteem. I was shy, withdrawn, and had terrible social skills (e.g. could not maintain eye-contact).

Phase 1: I’m sure many of you can relate. I tried drugstore products (neutrogena, St. Ives, Biore pore strips, alcohol-based toners, spot treatment all over my face etc.). I looked through youtube to find any home remedies. I tried everything, feeling desperate, but to no avail. I regret many of the things I did.

Phase 2: I discovered “natural skincare,” like the OCM and essential oil-based products. These, of course, broke my skin out even further. My mom finally decided to take me to a dermatologist, and I tried benzoyl peroxide cream but that only dried out my skin. I was seriously considering more serious medical treatments at the point in time. Although I wore makeup, random people would point out my terrible skin out in public. I remember one time I updated my FB profile with a slight filter, and one guy (a high school classmate) asked if I had used photoshop. I had little to no confidence in how I looked.

Phase 3: I found out about Asian skincare and my skin gradually became better, but I still took a lot of wrong turns. I first used popular brands like cosrx, etude house, and innisfree without analyzing the ingredients. Although my skin became more hydrated and even, the spots did not stop popping up. I also tried fermented products like the Kiku toner, only to realize that I was FA-prone. That was another revelation. I realized that I had to pay attention and track the ingredient lists of my products, so I began doing that. I realized that I was sensitive to A LOT of ingredients, which makes my routine pretty bland but my wallet happy haha\~ Some of those are: Alcohol (high in list), most oils (especially essential oils), fragrance, niacinamide (maybe), sodium acetylated hyaluronate, chemical UV filters, honey (maybe), anything FA-related, glycolic/lactic/salicylic acid (moderately), etc.). This all took so much trial and error, but my skin was finally improving.

Phase 4: After leaving home for university, I came to the conclusion that I had to take care of myself holistically. I needed to nurture my body, brain, and mind altogether. This occurred to me after my first experience of depression and anxiety. Therefore, I began watching what I ate. I reduced the amount of sugar, gluten (for digestive problems), dairy (except occasional yogurt and cheese), and general junk food that I ate. I exercised a little each morning when I felt energetic and well-rested. I found hobbies outside of coursework to ease my mental fatigue. I started going out more to improve my social skills. I also simplified my skincare immensely, cutting out anything I didn’t need. Even though it was tedious at first, all of these soon became habits. Through these past few months, I’ve felt significantly better both physically and mentally.

Conclusions + Routine: Everyone has a different path in terms of their skin struggles but please continue to keep pushing forward regardless of the extent of your problems. I believe that we can all have good, not perfect, skin. I know that there are genetic predispositions, which I believe pertain to the level of environmental sensitivity of the skin (e.g. food, hormones, stress, pollution). However, I believe that everyone has a range and when we make an effort, we can climb higher to clarity.

157,AsianBeauty,[Discussion] Gel moisturisers or cream moisturisers?,"Hi everyone, I wanted to ask about opinions on whether you guys prefer using gel type moisturisers, cream types, or a mix of both? 

What kind of benefits do you get from each type, and do you prefer one kind over the other?

Do you have any recommendations for gels and creams that go well together in a routine to boost each of their effects?",t3_ca4yo0
158,AsianBeauty,[Discussion] pH of hybrid products like the Laneige Cream Skin Refiner?,"I've started this discussion to see how you (collectively) feel about pH levels, if you know the pH of your products, if the pH makes an impact on your routine/order, or influences your product choices, and finally if anybody knows the pH of the new ""skip-care""/hybrid products like the hyped Laneige Cream Skin Refiner? Where would such hybrid products fit in to a ph-balancing routine? Can it really be used as a toner/essence/moisturizer like it claims? What kind of pH does it need to have to adequately fulfill all those roles?

Below are my own thoughts and a little background:

So I've been using probably 90% AB in my 5-to-10-step (depending on the time of day and season) skincare routine for nearly the last 2 years,  and although some of the products have switched up, I've overall seen great improvements with the traditional layering method. However, the biggest changes for me came when I started to deeply understand pH and its importance in healthy skin and I really got nerdy about the pH levels at which various actives work their best magic. 

See, I used to think that I had sensitive, acne-prone, combination skin, until I realized that my skin wasn't sensitive or combination - it just wasn't ph-balanced. Nowadays, I can use much stronger products without worrying too much about the scary introduction phase, as long as I know the pH of a product and can fit it into my routine. Hell, most times I can tell by the ingredients and pH level of a product before I try it whether it'll be a hit for me or not.

Understanding pH, and even going so far as buying my own pH testing kit for all my products, really helped me to get the most out of my routine by allowing me to better layer in an optimal order so that my various actives weren't at competing pH levels on my skin (e.g. some items needed to go in a slightly counterintuitive order based on their ingredients, or they needed to be alternated by time of day or on different days based on other products). This in turn helped me reduce irritation and reactions.

I loooooove my long, drawn out AB skincare routine at night, but I'm admittedly always on the lookout for ways to shorten my routine in the morning. That's why I'm intrigued by the Laneige Cream Skin Refiner, especially since, as I've discovered that my skin type is actually mildly oily during the summer, I would love to be able to thin out my daytime layers and feel a little more refreshed. However, as a ph-lover, I'm a little disheartened that more pH info isn't available for a lot of products unless I can manage to get my hands on the physical bottle myself and test it. I really wish the pH range of products was just a default printed on the label as easily as the ingredients. I feel like this would be really helpful and could even tell people when things were outside their safe range as pH often changes over the life of a product. 

So are there any other pH nerds out there like me? Has anyone found or tested the pH of the LCSR or other hybrid products similar to it?",t3_ca40f9

168,AsianBeauty,[Discussion] What are your favorite inexpensive products?,"I was hoping in this thread we could share our favorite inexpensive products. Now I know that what is considered inexpensive is subjective but I think that under $20 might be a good mark. Personally I prefer products to be around $15 and under so that's the range I'm going to be suggesting myself. 

Here are my favorites that hopefully someone on a budget may appreciate knowing about. (I'm getting my pricing from Amazon I promise I'm not a shill for it lol)

**Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil: $10**

Everyone knows about this one. It's popular and reliable. 

**Innisfree Bija Jeju Anti-Trouble Cleansing Gel: $15**

This cleansing gel has a nice pH and what I like about it is that it doesnt bubble up at all. It stays a gel the whole way through. Its very gentle on my skin and doesn't leave my skin feeling tight. 

**Cosrx Hyaluronic Acid Hydra Power Essence: $15**

This is a simple essence that sinks into the skin nicely. It sinks in better when my skin is damp. Otherwise it can be slightly tacky. It's a nice hydrator and even better when sealed in with a moisturizer. I have oily skin so I use this alone in the morning with no moisturizer and it gives me just enough hydration. 

**Mizon Water Volume Ex Cream: $13**

I use this moisturizer at night time only since it really gives me that extra moisturization thats too heavy during the day. However its a nice light gel cream that sinks into my face super nicely and feels really cooling. This really makes my skin feel so smooth but I might search for something a tad lighter in the summer month. 

**Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish Sun Milk SPF 50+ PA +++: $10**

This is a mineral sunscreen and may not be for everyone. It makes my skin more matte even if I apply it when I'm really greasy. For oily people this might be great but for people who want to look really dewy this is not it. Its really light, sinks in super fast, feels nice and dry right away and has a pleasant faint lemony scent.

So thats all for me! Leave your recommendations for your best budget products!",t3_c9ko0b

173,AsianBeauty,I buy things so you don't have to #1: MISSHA Flash-Up Sun SPF50+ PA++++ [Review],"I got this on a total whim because I was running out of ""indoor"" or transitory sunscreen and wanting something stronger as I'm starting to use Tretinoin from Curology and want stronger sunscreen protection.

I was using Etude House's Sunprise Mild Airy Finish whatever whatever, SPF 50 PA+++.

I grabbed this on Amazon cause it looked interesting &amp; and my ""indoor"" sunscreen matters less and I've been wanting to explore.My needs in a sunscreen are: must be somewhat mattifying and can NOT be too oily or greasy, number one rule. I may alternate between sunscreens depending on needs.

&amp;#x200B;

**Skintype: naturally oily t-zone, on tret &amp; use professional strength chemical peels, so flakes &amp; being dry are a thing now**

&amp;#x200B;

Anywaysss:

&amp;#x200B;

This is my first MISSHA sunscreen &amp; possibly first product used (anything else was a sample). I grabbed it due to SPF &amp; PA rating &amp; interesting packaging, tbh. I skimmed the comments and a couple online reviews and went for it.

I have used it a few times. I like the packaging, I also rlly like holographic things. It squeezes out pretty easily. It is quite creamy, it's lotion-like &amp; a little thick but not too much so. I don't particularly remember a smell but it wasn't strong if there is one. It spreads easily, though I do rub it in more than I am maybe supposed so.

It goes on looking like a horrible white cast, and will look sort of weirdly UBER SHINY or possibly UBER GREASY looking at first. This was a bit weird to me, but after a few uses, I've come to realize this was the ""flash up"" thing it advertises. It has a sort of uberly dewy &amp; somewhat ""holographic"" look to it when first applied, and if you're dark, you may see a white cast. This does go away after sinking in for maybe a full thirty minutes.It doesn't feel heavy, and has a satin finish once settled. It does NOT have oil control, but it doesn't boast this, so. I will say it definitely doesn't seem to make it worse. My oil breaks through it in maybe 4 hours ish, and it stays semi dewy looking all day. I haven't tried makeup over it, only translucent powder.I'm unsure if it's another product cause this seems to happen on other days I don't use this, but it may be a bit much for on top of lids, as in slight stinging later in the day.

**I won't repurchase but I'm glad I tried it - I would suggest for those that are not oily, so normal to dry. Use only if you're cool with a slightly dewy look, and don't plan to rush out of the house right after applying. Give it time to settle, maybe 30mins - 1 hr. I have no issue w/ this as this is my ""Idgaf or I'm only indoors"" sunscreen.**

177,AsianBeauty,[Review] Daily Mild Sun Cream Pair,"Bought [this sunscreen](https://www.peachandlily.com/products/daily-mild-sun-cream-pair) from Peach &amp; Lily. SPF 50+ PA++++

I just got back from a week-long trip in Iceland, where the sun currently only sets for about 2 hours/day (and even then, it doesn't fully set, so it's never truly dark outside) and I went on 10+ hour hikes a day almost every day. Even though it was Iceland, it was also unusually sunny - I'm from LA and most days it was honestly as sunny as it is in LA, which the locals said was very unusual. So basically it was a TON of sun exposure.

Y'all. This stuff is the STUFF. I have extremely sensitive skin that's also prone to burning and I often get new freckles. This was the first trip I've been on where I didn't even get a little pink, and I didn't get one new freckle! I only wore beanies, no sun hats or anything, so I have to chalk my skin protection entirely up to the Daily Mild Sun Cream. It definitely protected my skin during a week of intense sunlight!

The cream itself feels light, and a little goes a long way. I was very diligent about reapplying every two hours, so I was doing 6+ reapplications per day, and my face never felt really greasy or gross with all the sunscreen. It comes out of the tube white but applies on clear and glossy - but I'm also very pale, so ymmv on the color. It's actually almost borderline TOO glossy - if you're not ok with a glowy look, this probably won't work for your aesthetic. I can't imagine achieving a matte face with this sunscreen, though I have yet to try applying makeup over it - that said, I thought I looked great in it, just noting this detail for people who aren't interested in the glass skin look. 

The biggest (and only, for me) drawback is the amount in the bottles. As soon as I took them out of the box it was immediately clear that both bottles were only about half full. I only brought one bottle with me to Iceland, and by the end of my trip the bottle was nearly empty. I'm on week 3 of owning this sunscreen and I think I'll be done with the first bottle within the next few days - I'm looking forward to seeing how long the second bottle lasts under more normal circumstances. I don't know if I think the total amount of sunscreen for your money is unfair, but I DO think that the size of the bottles feels deceptive, and it was a little disappointing squeezing it for the first time and feeling a ton of air in the packaging. 

That said, the product was so effective and felt so nice that I will definitely be repurchasing. I've been on the hunt for a decent sunscreen for my sensitive, acne-prone skin for nearly two years, and this is easily the best one I've tried. 

Very excited to be contributing to this community - I'm so thankful for how much I've learned here, and I finally felt like I had some input to give back. Hope this helps someone!",t3_c9549h

Welcome the two newest mods to our team, /u/thecaticorn and /u/conceptizual! They’ve actually been about, doing various modly things for the last few months, and we are super late at properly welcoming them to you.


Our new mods were chosen after our selection process, and we have been slowly training and integrating them into the mod work. We had one other mod /u/4soeur, who was recruited at the same time, but has since stepped back due to an international move. She has extensive experience modding other communities, loves gardening, and is an accomplished mother. We wish her well and all the luck! 

And to introduce our remaining recruits, /u/thecaticorn is a strong person working on her independence after graduation, and /u/conceptizual is a cheerful, easy-going and personable human. We are so lucky to have them, and thank you both for volunteering your time for the community!

More hands on deck, and more fresh ideas to add to the team! Some fun facts about our new mods:

/u/conceptizual: 

* Software engineer, loves to build infrastructure, maybe even things like mod queues
 
* Heritage is half-Mexican, but with self-described “solidly mediocre Spanish”

* May be our first-ever extrovert

* Really wants a pet dog but not yet

* Kpop fan, even covers dances in her spare time.

* her favorite thing she did to improve her skin was “stop being 14”

/u/thecaticorn:

* Recent IT undergrad

* Australian Representing, Indian heritage

* Solid AB community veteran

* Like all good people, also loves Avatar the Last Airbender (And Korra!)

* Into bubble tea as self-care

* Snowboarding beginner

Ever thought about joining the team yourself? Help steer the direction of your subreddit community! We can sometimes take a while to respond to (as we are not always in a recruitment cycle), but
 we encourage you to consider applying. We especially wish to recruit from diverse timezones for better ongoing support of the sub during all hours. We are also hoping to add perspectives from folks from LGBT+/Queer/GSM/SAGA backgrounds, folks with disabilities, older folks, and anyone with a unique perspective and a dedication to the community. Come apply! 

We love the folks who are great at self-motivated learning, diplomacy, seeing all sides of an issue, and being a good team player, as you will be working on a team with other mods from around the world. Experience modding other subs or large communities could be helpful but not required.

Anyway so I'm from a Tropical country, very humid and scorching heat everyday. I have Combination leaning towards Oily when it's summer and Dehydrated Sensitive skin. Its my first time to use this much product so I thought I'll share my thoughts on them. Also, A speculation is at the bottom of the review! Let me know what you think of it.


**Exfoliator**


**CosRx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid**


*7/10*


I'm surprised this was effective at all. It broke me out maybe once or twice. Didn't use it for a month then came back then it's okay. But as time goes by I never notice any improvements just a quick smooting the next day but it always goes back. Will repurchase but maybe in samples cause you don't need much then you don't also need to do everyday 



**Innisfree Jeju Volcanic Clay Mask**


*6/10*


I'm surprised somehow this never dries down. Broke me out at first and I didn't see effects. But I like how it made me feel like I'm doing self care for myself. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't I hate my face for being too sensitive. 😭


***Cleansers***


**Innisfree Jeju Cleansing Foam**


*7/10*


Bought this just because it's on a sale; heard it's high in pH but surprisingly doesn't dry me out. WRP only if I find other seller (tax was too high)


**CosRx Good Morning Cleanser**


*4/10*


I really wanted to like this! It's not drying compared to what I expected it but this cause me to have CCs that I never had before. Such a waste since it's really the cheapest

**Face Shop Dr. Belmeur Daily Repair Foaming Cleanser**


*7/10*


This one I really like. Checks all the boxes for me. Not drying, the smell wasn't too bad, doesn't leave residue and cleans really well. However I can't justify it's price for some reason. It's really pricey here in my country since I assume import tax.

**Human Nature Sunflower Oil**


*10/10*


I used this as first cleanser before using CosRx and damn if this product isn't the best! This product can be used in multiple situations too! When it's really cold and my skin cracks I use this on my legs and elbows. I also use this as facial oil, mixing it with some cream. I think it also heals insect bites but I'm not too sure about that. This is the best selling product of this brand so I bought it just to see what it can do and it deserves it! Really cheap too maybe around 4-5$. 

**Brandless Papaya Soap**


*8/10*


This was a localproduct and it's from a local family business. Surprisingly didn't broke me out! I'm usually skeptic when using brandless product because I don't know what's in it. But I was at a camping/party and it's the only one available at that time so I risked it. It dried me out though however it also dried out my active pimples! I will probably keep using this whenever I have breakouts.

***Acne Care***




**Human Nature Green Tea Acne Care**


*10/10 HG FOREVER*


When I say 10/10, it's 10/10. It's also a local brand but lately they've been expanding I think they sell online now. This is my go-to product whenever I have breakouts. Just dab it allover every night, every morning first thing on my routine and the acne will be gone in less than a week. It forms a film like texture to protect the acne from absorbing more dirt. My only complain is after using it for so many months probably years it became less effective in a sense that it will heal the acne a tad longer. I guess it's not even on the product but on my tolerance but I still use it for acne protection. Also very cheap, 4$!


**CosRX Pimple Patch**


*5/10*


Hated this just because it kept falling and irritating my acne. It was supposed to dry it but it made my acne more inflamed. Guess I have to just find a more effective one.


**Moisturizer**



**Soon Jung 10-Free Moist Emulsion**


*9/10*



I use this as Moisturizer sooo, this is super hydrating and the only one that really worked for me without purging or going through seven hells. In sunny or even hot nights I hated this just because it made me sweat on my philtrum area because it's really thick. I really love this im a sense that it's one of the few that didn't broke me out and leave scars. I bought the small version and I'm still using it for 6 months!

**Mizon Snail Cream**


*4/10*


Why. Did. This. Broke. Me. Out. I really wanted to love this!! It's the best feel from all that I've tried but I guess not everything works for my face.

**Mizon Snail Recovery Gel**


*8/10*


This is a must in summer! Leaves a matte texture, dries out quickly and doesn't make me oily throughout the day. I purged on this so bad I had to stop using it. But when I came back after a few months it was okay again! Guess I just have to try and try. I don't know what happened but I'm happy it worked. It has dimethicone in it which I didn't know so I used it on evenings which I think is not a good idea.

**Dr. Belmeur Ato Salt Cream**


*8/10*


Used it on first quarter of the year which is really cold and dry and this works like magic. I really loved how heavy and hydrating it is so I sometimes layer it twice. BUT used it on summer and this is a sticky mess. Heated my face and caused me to break out.

I'm planning to try out


- *Skinfood Sugar Masks

- More Actives (I'm kinda afraid of them because my skin just always self detonate when exfoliating)

- Kikumasamune Lotion

- The Face Shop Rice Cleanser

- Innisfree Green Tea Seed Serum

- More Local products

- Muji Toner and Moisturizer

- Laneige Water Bank*



Before I disappear I guess I wanna speculate how some local Products deem effective to my super sensitive skin. Is it because they're made specifically for our country's weather and majority of my nation's skin? Although I'm afraid cause there's a big risk of these products being discontinued as the sales are not as big as international brands. It's really amazing how all the local products I tried were effective. Or maybe it's just luck? Have you guys tried any local products that you really loved? I'm looking forward to seeing more potential local brands in the future!",t3_c94aw6

Not to mention the money it all requires.

187,AsianBeauty,Trying to find cooling shampoo I used at a Tokyo onsen,"I hope this post is allowed here.

I'm trying to find anything on a particular cooling shampoo that I used at a Tokyo onsen and I've stretched out my Google skills in my jetlagged haze.

Am back home now so can't go back, but maybe if I describe it a bit, someone here can help me.

It was the Thermae-Yu onsen in Shinjuku, and it was a medium blue bottle (shampoo only) with the word ""cool"" in an oval on the front above its name in hiragana (I think?).  There was also a corresponding shower gel (""body shampoo"") in a lighter blue bottle, also with the ""cool"" in an oval over the brand name.

I know this isn't a lot to go on, but hoping to get something that mighy lead me closer to it, at least!",t3_c8xygs

205,AsianBeauty,Your oily skin is NOT dehydrated,"I've run into this belief many times over the years: a person with oily skin should make sure to moisturize, since stripping the skin of oils would make the skin overcompensate with production of oils. This is incorrect, and the price I’ve paid for not doing any actual research on the topic has been shiny and oily skin. After I stopped caring about “overcleansing” and just started washing my face more often ceased moisturizing, except for my dry spots, I am now acne free and my skin no longer shines like a mirror.

The idea of overcompensation was dismissed by Miescher and Schonberg in a 1944 paper (Sakuma &amp; Maibach, 2012). They proved that the ratio between lipid delivery and size/number of glands is constant, which means that your skin produces a set amount of sebum over a given period of time. What this means is that if you have oily skin you shouldn’t be afraid to cleanse your face, as you might just have large and-/or vast sebaceous glands. It also means that your skin doesn’t “overcompensate” when you wash it too often – something which is in my experience frowned upon in certain parts of the community.

There is a great meta study from 2012 by Sakuma &amp; Maibach in the sources which goes into detail about oily skin, you should definitely check it out if you’re interested in the topic. I also posted a link to a referenced article by Kligman &amp; Shelley where they expand on the topic of sebaceous secretion.

Hope you learned something new!

I have suuuper oily skin and acne scars ( rolling scar type). I am not precisely  a 10 step skin care routine fan person, I tend to minimize the steps as much as I can, and currently I am using as a cleanser Himalaya Neem gel, then Biore UV rich essence (occasionally ionally Before I spray some rose water as a toner). With these two I am very happy and I can say I’ve been using them for a long time, after many years of trying unsuccessfully with others. 
The thing is, I would like to find a good AND oil absorbing pressed powder, or pact, not too pale ( I guess I am one tone below the 23, because that one is just a little too pale)...I am currently using TONYMOLY Cats wink Clear Pact, which I honestly think is great, but it comes only in two shades, and the #2 is  too pale for me now that it’s Summer.

*Super popular here as well, has a lot of skin-soothing &amp; healing stuff! I hope I don't make too many people angry by saying this, but I have this as well. It's soothing but if I'm being completely honest, the Purito centella green level buffet serum &amp; benton aloe BHA toner gave me better results (surprisingly,, purito has essential oils). I use both at the same time and it calms down a huge zit forming overnight. I tried to do that many times with LRP's cica balm but it;s not as anti-inflammatory as the other two, at least for my skin.*

Water, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, **Squalane, Hydrogenated Lecithin**, **Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter,** Betaine, **Honey Extract,** Royal Jelly Extract, **Beta-Glucan**, Portulaca Oleracea (Common Purslane) Extract, Phytosteryl/Octyldodecyl Lauroyl Glutamate, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1, 2-Hexanediol, Sodium Carbomer, Carbomer, **Chamomilla Recutita.**

&amp;#x200B;

*This is filled with some skin-loving/identical oils. One of the main points of mango butter is that it has skin soothing/healing properties, but it's not greasy. Honey is very good for skin because of its sugars and antioxidant value. Also, a few studies show that it can be healing for wounds. Royal Jelly, however, does not have any evidence of helping skin a whole lot.*

*Potentially problematic ingredients: The oils in this are great, but the high % olive oil may be bothersome to acne-prone skin types. YMMV.*

**Niacinamide 10% Treatment - 4.38/5 (50 Reviews)**

30ml/1 oz - 5,900 won/**$5.10 USD(!!!!)**

Water, **Niacinamide,** Butylene Glycol, Dipropylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Panthenol, Glycereth-26, Centella Asiatica Extract, Portulaca Oleracea (Common Purslane) Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) (German Chamomile) Extract, Vitex Agnus Castus (Chaste Tree) Extract, Saccharide Isomerate, **Acetyl Glucosamine**, Allantoin, Glyceryl/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, PVM/MA Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium EDTA.

&amp;#x200B;

**PROS**

""The price!!!!!"" x50

Sensitive skin friendly

Fast results for some (5-7 days) in terms of better skin texture/overall appearance, more resilient/stronger/balanced feeling

Lightweight/watery, non-sticky

Lightly Hydrating

Few reviewers said it really worked in brightening their skin after using for a while (\~1 bottle) (Reviewer states you MUST use past 3 months to see significant brightening)

Brightened enough to switch to lighter shade foundation

Large pores disappeared

Improvement in uneven bumpy skin texture, makes skin soft, reduction in redness/inflammation

Inflamed acne is better

No fragrance

&amp;#x200B;

**CONS**

Many felt that they did not see an increase in noticeable brightness (some reviews said they only used it for like 3 days,,,, girl...). People expected DRAMATIC results because it's 10%!! (a lot of people used the English word ""dramatic"" to describe what they thought the results would be, lol.)

Doesn't help active acne

Recovery Booster performed better in brightening

Dropper is annoying

Not hydrating enough

Few people broke out pretty badly

Too watery

Very sensitive skin need to mix it with other products

&amp;#x200B;

**PROS**

*Amazing* at soothing upset skin

Absorbs well, lightweight

Acne disappeared

Really strengthens skin

Great for very sensitive skin

Really hydrating

Affordable

Unfragranced

Putting it on about-to-form zits makes them go away (lots of reviews in general talking about it calming their acne significantly)

&amp;#x200B;

**CONS**

Smells like shit

Wish it was more accessible (physically) - 2sol is an online-only brand

Too drying for really dry skinned people

Caused breakouts for few

Heavy when you put on too much (pump makes it hard to control how much comes out)

Didn't really see a difference

Also, it smells like shit

&amp;#x200B;

**PROS**

*Very* hydrating - lots of reviews stating how moisturized their skin feels compared to a routine without it

Light, absorbs well, non-sticky (slightly thicker than water)

Fast results! (Brightening) (\~2 weeks)

Doesn't pill under other products/foundation

Great ingredients for sensitive skin/effectiveness - no alcohol

Unfragranced/no strong smell

(Reviewers seem very surprised to find that the serum is not heavy despite the word ""recovery"" in the name.)

Calming for sensitive or inflamed skin

Skin actually did not look bad as it usually does when tired/sleep-deprived/stressed *(I get this effect too, from my Timeless vitamin C serum. My pores get giant and texture is all bumpy and weird when I pull a allnighter, but not if I use the vitamin c in my night routine.)*

Skin feels noticeably healthier

&amp;#x200B;

**CONS** (Most of the cons begin with ""I don't really have anything bad to say about it, but if I'm being really picky.."")

Really watery

Slight medicinal smell

Didn't see dramatic brightening (these users did not specify the length of time they used the product. The ones that did were disappointed to not see brightening after using for 10-13 days bc other reviews stated that they saw very fast results.)

Too strong for very sensitive skin

Stings on open wounds

Concerns about using it in the AM bc sunlight *(Not sure why some reviewers feel this, because there's nothing in there that's photosensitive? Maybe it's the belief that vitamin C makes you more sun sensitive. But it actually boosts your sunscreen and has a photoprotective quality!)*

I'm making some top 10-20s for each category for those of you guys who cannot read Korean or don't use the app. Thanks!

Ingredients from various websites, double checked with ones from Hwahae, or typed straight from Hwahae.

&amp;#x200B;

*I'm really excited about this section. I'm not happy that Korea is and has been for years, swamped in pollution from the winds carrying it over. There is a lot of microdust and even people with resilient skin reported getting redness &amp; severe irritation from the pollution. Everyone has to wear these giant masks, sometimes special ones, and limit their exposure to the world outside of their homes.*

*So there has been a lot of push for soothing, calming products and ""clean"" ingredients. A lot more focus on repairing the skin barrier. So I'm excited about those, but not the fact that people have to suffer.*

*I'll be bolding some of the soothing, repairing and/or skin-identical ingredients in the ingredient lists. I don't know every good ingredient, but I will bold the ones that I do know of. Some other beneficial ingredients as well.*

*\*Also got random pictures of the textures of the creams and the users who posted it.*

*If you're interested in barrier repairing/replenishing as I am, here are some good quotes from Susan, from Swift Crafty Monkey blog:*

&gt;**Natural moisturizing factor (NMF)** is found within the corneocytes, and makes up 20% to 30% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum. It **consists of amino acids (40%), sodium PCA (12%), lactate (12%), urea (7%), ions (18.5%), sugars (like glycerol – 8.5%)**, and a few other things. These are water soluble [humectants](https://swiftcraftymonkey.blog/better-crafting-through-chemistry/) (meaning they draw water out of the atmosphere to our skin) that have a huge impact on the biochemical and mechanical properties of our skin. Having an adequate NMF level in our skin can prevent or reduce skin tightness, cracking, scaling, and flaking. It improves our skin’s plasticity (thanks to the interactions of the amino acids with keratin) and helps maintain skin’s barrier properties.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Filaggrin** is a really important protein found in our skin! ...When we are in more arid climates, the filaggrin breakdown increases to produce more NMF. More NMF is a good thing!  
&gt;  
&gt;The contents of the NMF do more than act as humectants. The lactate and potassium can affect the pH and stiffness of the stratum corneum. The lactic acid stimulates ceramide biosynthesis and improves barrier function. The [hyaluronic acid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan) (HA – picture to the left) maintains hydration and structural integrity of our skin. It also interacts with intercellular lipids and regulates the mechanical properties of the stratum corneum.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[The strateum corneum lipids\] make up about 15% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum, and contain about **40% to 50% ceramides, 20% to 25% cholesterol, 15% to 25% fatty acids** (those with C16 to C30 chain lengths, with C24 to C28 being the most common), and **5% to 10% cholesterol sulfate**.  
&gt;  
&gt;Oils with **linoleic or gamma-linoleic acid** are always welcomed by our skin (like sunflower, sesame seed, borage, evening primrose, rice bran, and others), especially in the winter.

**Squalane, beeswax, lecithin, lanolin** are also good skin replenishing ingredients. Shea butter is very soothing and moisturizing, as well as having a lot of antioxidants.

*Panthenol, d-panthenol, or dexpanthenol is awesome at healing and soothing. 2-4% is okay too, but it has absorbency issues, so 5-10% is when it's really effective (according to Susan). But perhaps penetration enhancers make this better. Squalane is the stable version of our skin-identical friend. Looks like this has a high % of madecassoside as well, that I haven't seen elsewhere yet.*

224,AsianBeauty,Dupe for Pony Effect Favorite Fluid Lip Tint?,"Hello! First time posting here so sorry if I did anything wrong!

I’ve tried a lot of lip tints already but because of my lip shape (size? Plumpness? Haha) combined with them just being dry, they all end up uneven on me. The only ones that have worked are the balm based ones (which do not last as long) or the oil-based ones.

That said, Pony Effect’s favorite fluid lip tint goes on glossy/hydrating and dries down matte like a true stain, which is why it worked for me. Unfortunately i recently had to throw mine away as it was just too old and i have only been able to buy them when I visited seoul :( none of the online stores that ship to my location carry it either.

Would anyone know of a good dupe for it? To be specific, I’m not fond of the bright shades AB lip tints mostly offer. I liked Pony’s because it pulled as an MLBB color on me (in the shade “Very Good”). I currently have the EH Dear Darling in PK003 and it is a color dupe but as I’ve said it turns out patchy :(

Thanks in advance!!!! Xoxo i’m blessing everyone with skin hydration and bounce!",t3_c7crsr

*The recent reviews for this I read were things like: such a nice toner, helps with texture/calming, no cons; A few stated that it dries down slightly sticky; Watery, clear, like that it's unscented. Some people expected it to be an exfoliating toner but found out it's not (didn't we all lol). I use this as well, and I really like it. It's very soothing with 0.5% salicylic acid.*

226,AsianBeauty,[Guide] Hwahae Rankings: Top 40 Skins/Toners (06/28/2019) PART ONE,"Hwahae: It's a review/ranking app for Koreans for beauty-related things. I'm making some top 10-20s for each category for those of you guys who cannot read Korean or don't use the app. Thanks!

Ingredients from various websites, double checked with ones from Hwahae, or typed straight from Hwahae.

&amp;#x200B;

*In Korea, toners are called ""skin"" (although more recently ""toner"" has caught on as well, probably from Western influence/to make it easier to sell in the West). Usually, lotions mean light emulsions. Sometimes it can mean something between ""emulsions"" and creams, I think, in terms of texture/thickness. ""Lotion"" in Japanese however, are toners from what I understand. Oops!! I meant to put 6/29 in the title. :x*

You can make ""banchan"" (side dish) with them, a bunch layered on top of each other drowned in soy sauce mix, or a spicy version with red pepper powder and garlic and such. Sometimes it's used as a wrap for meat. It's thick and kinda hairy feeling if you eat it fresh/raw. I much prefer it made into banchan to get rid of that hairiness.*

**Build Me A Routine, /r/AsianBeauty!** Please refrain from just stating a skin concern then expecting people to build a routine from scratch.  It is important to do due diligence in understanding your skin type and needs. Learn more here in [The AB Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/theabroutine) or [The Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/index).

&amp;#x200B;

**1.** \[**BEPLAIN\] Cicaful Ampoule - 4.34/5 (3,174 Reviews)**

30ml/29,000 KRW

Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth-20, Polyglycerin-3, Pentylene Glycol, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Sodium Hyalutonate, Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate, Lactobacilius/Rice Ferment, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Xantham Gum, 1,2 Hexanediol, Ethyhexylglycerin.

*The few reviews I have read for this say that it absorbs fast, is pretty soothing, and some people state that it really helped their acne. The expectation seems to be that it's supposedly very good for acne prone skin. There are pictures of someone with pretty bad acne showing before and after pictures of their acne going away. (Korean skin care is more geared toward CALMING &amp; SOOTHING acne than to go to war with it with drying treatments and whatnot. I guess because a large component of acne is inflammation?)* 

*Some people said it doesn't seem to do anything for them, sensitive types seems to like it a lot, that it absorbs quickly. They like that it's unfragranced. Some VERY oily types said they feel like their skin is a little bit more oilier when they use it and that it doesn't absorb well for them. It may be really popular due to Director Pi suggesting it as the #1 soothing ampoule in her recent video. I see Director Pi's name pop up quite a lot in reviews in general.*

**2. \[BADSKIN\] Collagen BOMB Hydrating Ampoule - 4.28/5 (5,002 Reviews)**

400ml/24,000 KRW (400ml ampoule??!)

Hydrolyzed Collagen, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Water, 1,2 Hexanediol, Trehalose, Carylyl Glycol, Allantoin, Propanediol, Brassica Olearacea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Medicago Sativa (Alfalfa) Extract, Brassica Oleracea Capitata (Cabbage) Leaf Extract, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Brassica Campestris (Rapeseed) Extract, Raphanus Sativus (Radish) Seed Extract, Betaine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hyaluronic Acid.

*Reviews for this basically say that this is ULTRA moisturizing. A little bit on the heavier side so oily skin may not like it, but all the dry skinned people seemed to really, really love this. It's cheap, very hydrating, absorbs well. However, a few oily people said it takes a little bit to sink in for them.*

*This is a very popular product. This and their Galactomyces Niacin Ampoule have been consistently on #1/somewhere in the top 20 list since their debut in 2012 according to Director Pi. This ampoule has been #1 for like forever from what I'm gleaming. However, their expiry is 2 years unopened, and 6 months opened. Supposedly studies done by Estee Lauder say that bifida ferment has been shown to strengthen your skin barrier over time and make it less sensitive to things. Director Pi says ferments provide very, very gentle form of exfoliation.*

*This looks like Hada Labo lotions tbh. :o Except with more skin soothing things like panthenol, witch hazel, madecassoside, allantoin and such. The color looks really pretty.*

*Honestly, I feel like a lot of these rankings, except perhaps the first top 10, is slightly arbitrary. Just because it takes the # of reviews into account. You can find lots of good reviews vouching for very good products with lesser amount of reviews. It doesn't necessarily mean that just because a product is extremely popular, there can't be lesser known amazing products as well. For some categories, like toners and creams, I feel that it's worth to look all the way down towards the 40s and 50s. I think I will make certain categories longer if you guys don't mind my spamming, lol.*

There has been threads centred on Vit C,  Niacinamide and a dozen other ingredients, but never panthenol, so I thought I'd start one.

*A Lil Note on Panthenol:*

&gt;Panthenol is the alcohol form of the B vitamin pantothenic acid. Panthenol is used in skincare products as a humectant because of its ability to attract and hold moisture. Research has shown it aids in wound healing, improving the skin's barrier function, restoring damaged epithelium as well as reducing itching and inflammation. Panthenol is usually used at concentrations ranging from 0.5-5%, although 2-5% has been shown to be the ideal concentration in promoting wound healing and repairing skin damage.",t3_c6xova

237,AsianBeauty,"Tosowoong's S.O.S. Cica Madecare ointment, undisclosed steroids, and companies refusing to name ingredients in ""proprietary formulas""","Update 7/3: A photo of the quasi-drug fact sheet was found! No steroids listed, woo!

\------

I recently purchased the Tosowoong SOS Repair Cica Clinic Madecare Ointment based on a recommendation I saw here. One user said it was super calming and erased the redness on her post-waxed legs almost immediately, like magic. A couple others have mentioned using it daily as a sleeping pack, which is what I purchased it for. I gave it a try last night on my face while having a itchy red flare-up from allergies and irritation, and sure enough, the itch went away in seconds and my skin calmed down entirely within minutes. I was, to put it lightly, shocked. The only time I've ever experienced that type of instantaneous relief before is when I've used topical steroid creams like hydrocortisone.

I've been concerned with product labeling on ""soothing products"" ever since 2014, when [Mario Badescu was caught putting undisclosed steroids](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lawsuit-filed-against-mario-badescu-for-undisclosed-steroids-279184841.html) (hydrocortisone and triamcinolone, a prescription-only steroid) in their Healing Cream and Control Cream for years. Of course, as soon as the steroids were removed from the formulas, customers were hit with steroid rebound syndrome (severe redness, burning, and sloughing) and some customers suffered irreversible skin thinning and atrophy as a result of long-term steroid use.

I did a search for ingredients but came up empty handed. I also tried to reach out to Tosowoong (in English) for a list of their ingredients, but they haven't responded to me. I did a search and apparently others have tried to ask Tosowoong for the ingredients of this ointment, and they have refused to disclose them because it's a ""proprietary formula."" Does anyone know if this is still true?",t3_c6u55u

241,AsianBeauty,[Guide] Testing out Japanese sunscreens,"I saw a Japanese article that looked really interesting so I thought I'd share with you guys :)   


https://i.redd.it/h7ye2246y0731.png

This article tested out 18 Japanese sunscreens to find the best sunscreen based on these criteria: 

1. Sun Protection  
They used these UV boards (will show up later in the post), put sunscreen over them, and left it out for 5 minutes. If the board is slightly pink, it means that some UV rays got through.   


2. Feel  
They checked for stickiness after applying a second time, spreadability, white cast, and fragrance. Note that this is a Japanese website so white cast may be unreliable for your skin tone. 

3. Water Repellency   
This test was used to see how the sunscreen would hold up when you're sweaty. They used artificial leather, applied sunscreen and waited for 30 minutes, dropped water on it and picked it up to see how much water fell down. The less water left on the leather, the better.   
(OP note: kinda iffy about this test because they tested some non water resistant sunscreens. I think it's still interesting though.)

4. Gentleness   
\+5 pts if they only use zinc oxide, 4 pts if they have chemical UV scattering agents, 3 pts if they use a mix of scattering and absorbing agents, 2 pts if they use chemical UV absorbing agents, additional +0.5 pts if they don't use alcohol

5. How easy it is to wash off  
After leaving sunscreen on a strip of artificial leather for 3 hours, they used a foaming cleanser to wash off the sunscreen. The less residue left, the better.   


Now, they tested 18 sunscreens but I picked out some of the most popular sunscreens on this subreddit. I also decided to only include the picture of the UV boards because the original article was pretty picture heavy. If you want to see the full list and pictures, you can see it at their page: [here](https://the360.life/U1301.doit?id=6361)

Onto the list!

243,AsianBeauty,[Guide] Hwahae Rankings: Top 10 Cleansing Balms/Milks/Creams &amp; Foams (06/27/2019),"Finally downloaded Hwahae. It's a review/ranking app for Koreans for beauty-related things. I'm making some top 10-20s for each category for those of you guys who cannot read Korean or don't use the app. Thanks!

Ingredients from various websites, double checked with ones from Hwahae, or typed straight from Hwahae.

&amp;#x200B;

HwaHae bundles cleansing balms, milks, and creams together. The category name is just ""Cleansing lotion/creams"". Balms don't have a separate category.

This weekend I'll cover Essence/Ampoule/Serum and Cream sections. There are also Cleansing Waters, Lip/Eye Remover, Skin/Toner section, Lotion/Emulsion, Gel, Mist, and Face Oil sections, but I'm not sure if I'm going to cover all of them. Let me know if you do want a section covered. I'll try to cover them.

&amp;#x200B;

In the future I want to cover:

\- Top 20 sun lotions/creams (maybe also Sun sticks section and Sun Cushions)

\- Sleeping packs!

\- BB/CC Creams (separate from Foundations, Cushions, Tone Up Creams)

\- Makeup Base (there is a separate section for primers)

\- Shading (contouring products)

\- Eyebrow makeup (maybe also Eyeliners)

\- Lip tints

\- Lip balms/Lip Care

245,AsianBeauty,"[review] 6 months into Asian skincare long and honest review (tony moly, cosrx, the face shop, acwell, benton, hada labo and mizon)","**EDIT** the face shop rice oil gave me perioral dermatitis,irritated my face and gave me red bumps in my eye area i dont recommend this if you are sensitive to fragance (even when dtays short time on your face can irritate) 

**first** of all I want to apologize for any mistakes my mother language is not English **second** this will be a long post and many well known products will be here so I’m sorry if this is redundant to you and also this is my first review ever (I’m so excited!!)

**1.** before I found out about Asian skin care and this subreddit my skin was covered by painful and inflamed white heads, tons of closed comedones , black heads, PIH and was dull and super dehydrated ( I did not know about dehydrated skin) my routine consisted on kiehls calendula cleansing gel and calendula toner in the morning (yes, no sunscreen and no moisturizer), in the evening same cleanser and toner plus a small amount of kiehls ultra facial cream.

**Skin type** sensitive prone to dehydrated (25y/female)

**Issues** dehydration, black heads on nose and PIH (yes I got rid of white heads, CC's and dullness)

**Location** where I live we don’t have seasons the temperature goes from 17° (in the coldest days) to 30(super hot days)° not humid or dry and very polluted.

**Current routine**

mizon snail repair eye cream

cosrx advanced 92 snail all in one cream

**2 reviews**

I decided to try tony moly first because it’s the only Asian skincare brand with physical stores in my country

***tony moly wonder rice smoothing toner (5/10) won’t repurchase again:*** this was my first Asian toner, this slightly smoothed my face, not very hydrating, worked for the 7 skin method. did not improved my hyperpigmentation, deeply hydrated or exfoliated my skin as it claims, did not damaged my skin neither this was just normal was like putting home rice water on my face. good content and cheap may work for really sensitive skin.

***tony moly the chok chok green tea watery essence (4/10) wont repurchase again:*** at first I felt in love with this essence (I decided to ignore the smell of alcohol ) made my face look so glowy and fresh I even applied 2 layers or mixed with my foundation until after 2 or 3 weeks I started to get some redness and irritation at the end of the day, I decided to stop using this and the irritation and redness went away also some CC's . it’s so sad because this gave such a beautiful glow to my skin that I never have before, I tried to use it again in my new routine but with the same bad results.

\*\*\*tony moly goat milk premium moisture cream (1/10) wont repurchase again:\*\*\*Ok people so far this is the worst moisturizer that I ever tried, this gave me white heads and CC's every time I tried it, sits forever on my face and smells awful the only reason I don’t give it a 0 it’s because this kind of helped to heal my moisture barrier. I gave it to my dad who broke out too and he gave it to my mom who could not stand the smell.

***cosrx good morning low ph cleanser (3/10) won’t repurchase again:*** unpopular opinion but I wanted to love this cleanser so bad but it was a big disappointment. this never washed off I made a post and some other people said they had the same problem (many people told me that the water of my city could be the problem) also my face felt tight after this. I liked the tea tree smell on this, it was also cheap.

***cosrx aha 7 whitehead power liquid (8/10) may repurchase again:*** I’ve been using this for 3 months this was my first chemical exfoliator I introduced this slowly first once a week , now twice a week and from next week will use for 3 times a week. I stopped getting white heads before this so I can´t tell if this actually works for them but pretty sure this helped me to get rid of closed comedones. I love that there is some niacinamide on this, does not irritate my skin but whenever I use this I know my skin will need some extra hydration.

**cosrx one step original clear pads (10/10) will repurchase again:** I’ve been using this for 3 months, this was a game changer when my skin was a completely mess pretty sure this helped me to get rid of CC´s and whiteheads. I use this when I feel my skin is about to act up (I’m a model and sometimes I get super heavy editorial make ups or multiple make ups in a day) and at the end of the day I notice some small cc's(not sure if they are cc's but they’re small not read bumps), weird red bumps and irritation) I use this and immediately my skin feels calm and soothed and the next day the bumps are mostly gone. this helped my brother with his cystic acne

***cosrx advanced snail mucin 96 power essence (10/10) will repurchase:*** I don’t want to talk so much about this, it’s a well known product, became HG, help scarring process my entire family end up using this too

***cosrx advanced 92 snail all in one cream (9/10) won’t repurchase:*** my skin drinks this, this makes my skin glowy and plump sometimes at night I use two layers of this and my skin looks so hydrated in the morning, I don’t love the sticky texture but once applied it gets absorbed in less than 30 mins. the reason why I won’t repurchase it’s because I think 2 snail products in my routine its redundant I will like to try other creams with ceramides, green tea ...

***hada labo gokujyun hyaluronic acid lotion moist (9/10) won’t repurchase:*** this is a well known product. did not notice a huge change until I started layering multiple times, does not break me up, I love how good this is for my prone to dehydrated skin but I already ordered the premium version.

***the faceshop rice water bright light cleansing oil (2/10) won’t repurchase:*** this was my first oil cleanser ever and I can't tell how I lived so many years without this step. this get off heavy makeup and mascara so easy , make my skin feel soft and I notice a reduction of black heads in my nose on the other hand this sting and irritates my eyes and blurry my vision I think I will replace this with hada labo cleansing oil or heimish all clean balm

***mizon snail repair eye cream (7/10) wont repurchase:*** I spent a month without eye cream, I was just tacking my other products to the eye area (hada labo hyaluronic acid lotion, cosrx snail mucin essence and cream) and then I ordered this to compare so I could decide if eye cream is worth it or not. I don’t notice any difference I want to try some other eye creams but I’m reaching the conclusion that they are not worth it (I’m open to recommendation)

***Benton snail bee high content steam cream (2/10) wont repurchase:*** I ordered a travel size kit from Benton I was so excited to try this but was such a big disappointment, first thing I hated the texture so thick felt that I had to rub this on, my skin normally drinks every cream so fast but this kind of sits in my face letting me look greasy, also I had the first white head in months :( and some closed comedones around lip area

***acwell licorice ph balancing cleansing toner (9/10) may repurchase***\*\*:\*\* not so long ago I made a post here looking for the perfect cleansing toner and so many people raved about this. I’ve been using this for less than a month but it’s exactly what I was looking for its a gentle toner that helps me to clean de residues from the night I just wash my face with water in the morning but is not enough to remove dust and sweat, this toner does the job and I noticed that when I used my skin feels so soothed and fresh I’m dying to try de mist version. I don’t give it a 10 because I think it’s too pricey for such low content, I love the packaging and the natural herb smell on this.

**3 new haul:** as i mention before i ordered a travel kit from benton products and i really want to try the benton snail bee high content essence and the aloe bha toner.

i also have on my haul the pyunkang yul moisture cream, essence toner and moisture serum (im dying to try this)

**waiting for:** shipping to my country takes forever but melaco cc and hada labo premium lotion are on my way.

**Whats on my shopping cart:** innisfree no sebum mineral powder, meishoku caracolla perfect gel, klairs fundamental ampule mist, cosrx bha power liquid, cosrx hydrium green tea aqua soothing gel cream, heimish all clean balm, etude house suun jung ph6.5 whip cleanser

**im looking for:** A dupe for ***tony moly the chok chok green tea watery essence*** that does not contain alcohol

**curious about:** klairs, purito and asian sunscreens",t3_c6ch6j

Is Avobenzone the only UVA filter... How can it have PPD 16+? It seems Ensulizone (which is primarily a UVB filter) can get a boost in UVA protection when combined with Avobenzone and while this excludes the Octinoxate filter, it shouldn't degrade Avobenzone. 

Is it possible to achieve it with these filters and this specific combination and if so why don't US companies do it? Anyone else find it strange how this can have such a high PPD rating?",t3_c6iow9

266,AsianBeauty,[REVIEW] Biore UV Perfect Milk SPF 50 ( 2019 Formula / Blue bottle ),"I recently got this and have been using it for 2 weeks. It wasn't until after buying it where I've read about the reformulation and people's concerns with it. I have not used the old formula but here's my take on this one:

1. It is affordable - I got it for $15CAD for 40ml
2. The finish is MATTE. I read people complaining that it is greasy and never dries down, but I've never experienced this. I shake the bottle REALLY well and the product comes out opaque white. I have extremely oily T zone but drier around my chin area. Dry skin folks - AVOID
3. Takes a while to fully mattify. I would say 10-20 minutes.
4. I wash my face using Hada Labo Rohto Gokujyn Hyaluronic Acid Cleansing Foam, followed by ROHTO Melano CC and Cerave moisturizing lotion before applying this sun screen on top. 
5. Very little white cast initially but seems to go away after a while.
6. I would say the finish is like the Australian Gold tinted sun screen (which I also talk about here) but lighter and comfortable.
7. I was worried about the alcohol level in this as well, but so far it has not irritated my skin.

This is literally the only mask that's irreplaceable for me, so I'm worrying a bit.

269,AsianBeauty,[Review] Benton travel kit,"I’m 22 with combination skin that is also very sensitive. Recently I ran out of skin care products and I found this little kit at a very good price in an online store so I decided to buy it since I’ve tried some benton products before and they worked for me. 

https://i.redd.it/em6c1f03gf631.jpg

I haven’t tried the Honest cleansing foam since I’m currently using neogen green tea and I didn’t want to waste its expiration date. As well as the cleansing water because I don’t use make up other than mascara that I clean with coconut oil.

Aloe propolis soothing gel. It’s as good as any other aloe vera gel. I tried it before when I was introducing myself to korean skin care and tbh I prefer other brands that are less expensive and have way more product. I mean it’s good but for it’s price I prefer other options that have more % of aloe

Aloe BHA skin toner. I also tried this some years ago. I like it because it feels refreshing. It’s a nice toner but nothing special.

Snail bee high content Essence. I never tried an essence before. I really like this, it feels good but I see nothing special on my face. I think it feels like a toner. I’ve been using it for three weeks and already running out of it. 

Fermentation Eye cream. I’m just getting started with eye cream, never really mind about it since I’m only 22. I like this, I don’t know how an eye cream is supposed to feel but I think this feels kind of thick, I don't mind it tho. I’m not sure if I have seen results or I’m just sleeping better. I don’t know if I would buy it again, I feel like it’s a little expensive and my under eye problem is not that bad so maybe I’ll keep on trying other brands. 

Snail bee high content steam cream. I feel like it’s a good moisturizer but it does make my skin a bit… oily? it feels very thick. I’m only applying it at night and on my cheeks since I’ve recently have breakouts in my forehead. It feels good but I'm scared it would cause me break outs if I apply it to all my face. 

Overall I think it’s a good starter kit for anyone who hasn’t tried korean skin care before. Plus it comes with a nice pouch. The aloe products are really good and I would buy them again. The snail bee products may be a little too much for my skin type.",t3_c52cy7
270,AsianBeauty,[Discussion] Has anyone tried the Muji Clear Care Skincare series?,"Recently I paid Muji a visit, and to my surprise found a skincare line I had not noticed before called the 'Clear Care' series. More information online [here](https://www.muji.com/hk-en/skincare/clearcare/). According to their website, the products are targeted towards acne prone skin and minimising pores, overall refining one's skin balance. It also contains hyaluronic acid for its hydrating properties and natural fruit extracts.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm always on the hunt for new products to try, and I'm honestly just curious as so whether or not this skincare series actually works. My combo skin with oily pores could potentially benefit from the products.

* Have you tried these products, and what were the pros and cons?
* Do you see any changes in your skin balance (acne/pore reduction)?
* How does this perform in comparison with the popular Muji Sensitive Skin series?
* Is the price worth it?

I noticed a lot of people were upvoting the comment and thought this might be something to share. Get ready to scroll forever.

I originally tried to post this with the “Review” flair, but it wouldn’t go through. These are all reviews, not necessarily recommendations, and not necessarily related to science. I also tried to post with “Research,” but that didn’t work, either, so “Science” it is.

I’m a huge nerd who loves to have an app for everything. I definitely don’t think *anyone* should ever need all of these apps. **Please note that I live in Japan and am on an iPhone SE and a Mac**, so this excludes any apps that are unavailable to me. Also, I have a bit more time on my hands than usual at the moment, so this definitely gets pared down if I’m busy.

Please remember that it’s on each and every one of us to decide whether to trust any given source or not. I am neither scientifically inclined nor a beauty expert in any way. Any additions (not necessarily for me but for anyone reading this) are welcome!

# SKINCARE ROUTINE/TRACKING

If I were to pick just one app to use for this category, it would be either Skincare Routine or Curél肌手帳. Or Day One (with TextExpander) if the purpose is to pare down the sheer number of apps I have, because I would still be keeping it either way.

&amp;#x200B;

**Skincare Routine**

* **Links:** [Official website](https://mento.co.uk/skincare-routine/), [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1428570992) ($2.99 USD), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.theordinaryguide.app) (320 JPY)
* **Official description:** *Learn how to use DECIEM (The Ordinary, NIOD, Hylamide &amp; Fountain) products and create a personalized regimen for your skin care &amp; beauty treatments.*
* **Frequency of use:** Twice every day, but it’s only been a few days

I’ve known about this app for some time, but only just downloaded it based on the recommendations on the aforementioned thread because I don’t have any non-DECIEM products at all.

While you *can* set up “custom” (non-DECIEM) products, it takes a little time, which goes for any app that can’t automatically pull information for your products. I do like that you can also add things like hair products (which I haven’t added) and supplements (which I have added).

The products you’ve selected or entered are automatically put in place in your skincare routine (which can be different for AM/PM or specific days of the week, etc.) and you can check off products as you go each day, which is my favorite part of this app. The order doesn’t always seem to be perfect for custom products, but the checklist makes everything go smoother, and I like the indicator that tells you whether you used it in AM/PM routines over the past week, as well as the optional timer.

There is also a skincare diary function, which I don’t really use (see Day One for that; I may eventually decide to switch to Skincare Routine for that, but I was already using Day One so I’m sticking with it for now). It also gives you tips, tells you what ingredients shouldn’t be used together (though you have to be really diligent about entering information for any non-DECIEM products), etc. There’s a lot of attention to detail and I definitely haven’t mentioned everything here.

Overall, I think it’s a great app. I would even venture to say it’s almost everything I wanted in a skincare routine app. The one real problem I have with it is that it doesn’t respond to my taps/swipes very well (which could be specific to iPhone SE), so it can get a little frustrating when I’m using it. In fact, the interface feels cramped on my phone in general, but that goes for more and more apps these days. I also wish it could pull information for non-DECIEM products, but I doubt my mostly-Japanese products would be included anyway. Currently I’m trying to decide whether the tapping/swiping problem is enough to be a deal-breaker.

&amp;#x200B;

**Day One**

* **Links:** [Official website](https://dayoneapp.com), [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1044867788) (free), [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/day-one/id1055511498) (free); subscription-based premium plan
* **Official description:** *From once-in-a-lifetime events to everyday moments, Day One’s elegant interface makes journaling about your life a simple pleasure.*
* **Frequency of use:** A few times a day every day, but I use it for non-skincare purposes too

I use this mostly because I already had it on both my phone and my computer, with a premium account to boot. I made a separate Skincare Journal, where notes about my skincare routine, anything notable (new products, new pimples), and photos go. All of these can be covered by the Skincare Routine app above, but the thing about Day One is that you can lock it too. No one needs to see the most unflattering selfies in the world, not to mention close-ups of my nose and the like. It’s also convenient that I can use it on both my phone and my computer. I wouldn’t be using it nearly as much if it weren’t for the syncing with TextExpander (explained below), though.

&amp;#x200B;

**TextExpander**

* **Links:** [Official website](https://textexpander.com), [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/textexpander/id1075927186), direct downloads for Mac/Windows/Chrome on website; free for 30 days with subscription plans after that
* **Official description:** *TextExpander lets you instantly insert snippets of text from a repository of emails, boilerplate and other content, as you type – using a quick search or abbreviation.*
* **Frequency of use:** Any time I’m using my computer or any app on my phone that can sync with it (like Day One)

I know the subscription plan means it’s not for everyone, but I can’t live without TextExpander. I’ve also tried using another similar app in the past, when they first took the subscription route, but TextExpander seems to be better overall *and* it’s also available on my phone. You can use it with any app using the keyboard function, but I don’t like the keyboard and only use it when I really need it for an app that won’t sync snippets. Fortunately Day One is one of the ones that do (Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Update TextExpander Snippets).

Basically, you can set up specific snippets (e.g., ffanclo) that automatically expand to something else (e.g., Fancl Mild Cleansing Oil). That particular example can be set up in your default keyboard too (General &gt; Keyboards &gt; Text Replacement), but the thing with TextExpander is that you can also set it up to expand to a block of text, like my usual AM/PM routines, which can then be edited as necessary to reflect anything I did differently. The snippets can be case sensitive or not, the expanded text could be formatted or not, etc.

Again, like Day One, I already had the app and subscription for other purposes. As this one is only free for 30 days, I especially wouldn’t recommend it unless you also want it for non-skincare purposes. (That said, it’s completely essential for me in my professional life, and would wholly recommend it for anyone that thinks they might need it.)

&amp;#x200B;

**Habitify**

* **Links:** [Official website](https://habitify.me), [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1111447047) (free), [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1140787122) (free), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.unstatic.habitify) (free); subscription-based premium plan
* **Official description:** *Habitify is both a habit tracker and an accountable buddy that helps you form good habits while saving the most of your time.*
* **Frequency of use:** A few times every day, but this could change re: skincare

Also something I already had for other purposes. I use it to track/remind me to take supplements, to use actives I don’t use every day, etc., but I think the Skincare Routine app mentioned above might be able to take its place in that respect. This and other similar apps (there are a ton out there, I just happened to like this one, one big reason being that it’s also available on macOS) might be a good fit for you if you want to track and/or be reminded of specific things but don’t want to bother tracking your entire skincare routine.

&amp;#x200B;

**TroveSkin**

* **Links:** [Official website](http://www.troveskin.com), [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/troveskin/id1435184918) (free), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.trove) (free)
* **Official description:** *Analyze and track your skin – Measure your pores, wrinkles, spots and more to get personalized skincare recommendations*
* **Frequency of use:** Almost every day, but I’m thinking about deleting it

I think this app encourages obsession, so this definitely isn’t for those of you whose mental/emotional health is suffering in any way. The Skin Score and Skin Age fluctuate like hell and I’m convinced they mean nothing, so personally I have no problem ignoring those, but admittedly my heart sinks a tiny bit when my ratings for Spots/Pores/Texture/Wrinkles are lower than usual. I’ve never gotten anything but Excellent for one of those categories, but this just means I might start completely obsessing over it as soon as I get anything other than that. This is why I’m thinking about deleting the app. (And there’s also the thing with having these super-unflattering selfies on an app that can’t be locked, but it’s not like I don’t lock my phone anyway.)

One thing I really do like is how you can not only track and do side-by-side comparisons of selfies but also specific parts of your face, without having to take multiple photos. But then again, it uses the front-facing camera, which definitely isn’t great on my phone. The interface suffers a little, once again, on the screen of an iPhone SE (it looks nothing like the screenshot on the official website, by the way, so I’m a little confused). It also lacks a bunch of functions in Japan, but I think that may be a blessing. Like the Skincare Routine app, this also has a diary function where you can track products and other factors, but some of it is a pain on an iPhone SE.

&amp;#x200B;

**Curél肌手帳** (in Japanese only; may only be available in Japan)

* **Links:** [Official website](https://www.kao.co.jp/curel/special/curelapp/), [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1179625502) (free), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.kao.curel) (free)
* **Official description:** Curél肌手帳は乾燥性敏感肌の方のために考えられたお肌の記録アプリです。
* **Frequency of use:** Deleted, but may reinstitute at some point

This was the first skincare-specific app I used. It’s a skincare journal app made by Kao to promote their Curél brand, which is meant for dry sensitive skin. It’s a perfectly good app if you can read Japanese (actually, you might be able to use it based on the icons if someone helps you through the initial setup), and I might start using it again if I decide I can’t bear using Skincare Routine.

This is not just for skincare products and your face – you can also track stress levels, sleep, exercise, drinking, bowel movement, your menstrual cycle, the weather, and problem areas on your face, body, and scalp. And with a text field for notes about anything else. It’s super comprehensive without being overwhelming – you just tap on some icons to track these things, or nothing at all for the weather – and you can add non-Curél products too (although it helps for me that I have multiple Curél products in my routine). The one thing it doesn’t have in comparison to the other apps is any support for photos.

The only reason why I’m not using it is because I’m already tracking some of those things in another app, and I didn’t want to bother entering the same information multiple times. Also, you can obviously skip whatever you don’t need to track, but for some reason I feel the need to try to fill in every single blank, which is why something like Day One is better suited for me – I can be as detailed or minimal as I like on any given day without feeling bothered by it.

You do need to be okay with Kao having your information, I’m sure, but as a repeat Curél user, I would actually want them to be aware of my skin problems so that they could factor them in somehow in product development.

&amp;#x200B;

# FOR BEAUTY PRODUCTS

The winner for me here is Google Sheets, but I guess that isn’t really what you want to hear if you’re reading this. Maybe Beauty Keeper?

&amp;#x200B;

**Beauty Keeper**

* **Links:** [Official website](http://beautykeeperapp.com), [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id827915841) (free; 240 JPY to remove limits)
* **Official description:** *Beauty Keeper is a stylish, easy to use and handy app for iPhone that tracks expiry dates of your beauty products, reminds you when it is time to replace them, and helps to determine production and best before dates encoded by manufacturer.*
* **Frequency of use:** Only occasionally, but I find it helpful

I only started using this recently, but I wish I had it earlier. It pretty much does what’s in the description and nothing else. It’s one of those no-frills apps focused on a specific purpose, and that can be a very good thing. This comes in handy for products that I don’t use on a regular basis – they’re more likely to expire without being used up, and I don’t want them cluttering the products section in skincare routine apps. I also wouldn’t be entering makeup in my skincare apps, obviously. I still haven’t entered everything I own, but I’m making sure to enter anything I buy and I know it will help me down the line.

One minor gripe is that I can never use the batch code lookup because most of my products are Japanese and/or Japanese-market-specific. But I’m sure that will be the case with any app made outside of Japan.

&amp;#x200B;

**Google Sheets**

* **Links:** [Official website](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/), [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id842849113) (free), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.docs.editors.sheets) (free)
* **Official description:** *With Google Sheets, you can create, edit, and collaborate wherever you are. For free.*
* **Frequency of use:** Almost every day

I felt kind of weird looking for a page to link to for the official website. If you use Reddit, you probably at least know what Google Sheets is if you don’t use it already. But just in case you don’t, it’s the Google Drive version of a spreadsheet app, like Microsoft Excel or Numbers on macOS/iOS. You can also use it in your browser [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/).

Because I have more time right now, I finally sat down and made a spreadsheet, initially to understand UV filters and [my various sunscreens](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/bz8r9t/japanese_sunscreens_allie_extra_uv_gel_highlight/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) better. This expanded to include my skincare products, and then to also include makeup. This has kind of become a pet project at the moment, and I’m still adding to it all the time. I did consider making separate spreadsheets for each category, but I didn’t want to keep adding ingredients to multiple sheets – I don’t really know my ingredients, so I’ve been copying-and-pasting information from several sources. It’s kind of becoming a mega-resource, and I kind of want to share, but (a) the copy-and-pasted information would be infringing multiple copyrights, and (b) it’s always possible that I misread something and/or copy-and-pasted to the wrong cell – I’m definitely not as careful as I would be if it were for work – and I would hate to spread incorrect information.

While I understand perfectly that spreadsheets are not databases, and that this is not the “right” way to use the app, it does give me the ability to search and reorder the information by column, which is particularly useful for the mega-sheet on ingredients. Because I’m bilingual, I have everything in both English and Japanese, and I don’t have to be confused about anything that I only know in one language or the other. I also find the Grouping function very useful, because there are columns that only apply for specific kinds of products (like sunscreen), and I use Conditional Formatting a lot, too.

&amp;#x200B;

**@cosme 化粧品・コスメのランキング＆クチコミ** (in Japanese only)

* **Links:** [Official website](https://www.cosme.net/matome/I0009850), [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id793054713) (free), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.istyle.atcosme) (free); subscription-based premium plan
* **Official description:** 日本最大のコスメ・美容の総合サイト＠ｃｏｓｍｅ（アットコスメ）の公式アプリ／コスメの最新ランキング、クチコミをサクサク快適にチェック！1,400万件以上のクチコミが全部みれる！／タイムラインで最新美容記事をいつでもチェック！／商品スキャンでクチコミ探しも楽々！
* **Frequency of use:** More often than I would like to admit

This is the app version of the old-school cosmetics review website in Japan. I’ll write more about the website itself below, under Online Resources. I use it not only for research but also to document my notes on specific products (as reviews). There are other similar websites/apps that are probably easier to use, but this is the old school one and I’ve been using it for years. I personally don’t use the product-scanning function, but I imagine it would be handy for those of you who can’t read Japanese and want to check what the rating is for something you see in a store. (That said, I do have a few things to say about the ratings.) I *am* guilty of standing around in stores scrolling through reviews to decide whether something might be worth checking out or not.

I know there’s an English version of the @cosme website (discussed below), but I don’t think there’s an app. (Let me know if I’m mistaken!)

&amp;#x200B;

Apps I deleted within minutes but might possibly be worth checking out for others: **EWG’s Healthy Living App** ([official website](https://www.ewg.org/apps/), [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id703155791), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skindeep.mobile)) and **Think Dirty** ([official website](https://www.thinkdirtyapp.com), [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id687176839), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thinkdirty.thinkdirtyapp)), which are both for checking the safety of the ingredients used in your products. Both seem to be basically unusable for Japanese/Japanese-market-specific products, which is the majority of what I have. I’m also becoming increasingly wary of fear-mongering about various ingredients after doing research for my mega-spreadsheet discussed above, so I might not be using them much anyway. But who knows, maybe they could be useful.

&amp;#x200B;

# ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS: UV INDEX

Most of these apps (also in the next section) can be replaced by heavier-duty weather apps, but the ones I have require several taps to get to the information I want, so these more focused apps are useful to have.

&amp;#x200B;

**IFTTT** (specifically, the “Get a notification reminder to put on sunscreen when the UV index is high” applet)

* **Links:** [Official website](https://ifttt.com), [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id660944635) (free), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ifttt.ifttt) (free)
* **Official description:** *IFTTT is the free way to get all your apps and devices talking to each other. Not everything on the internet plays nice, so we're on a mission to build a more connected world.*
* **Frequency of use:** 24/7, in a way – I rarely open the app, but it’s always running in the background to run various applets automatically

IFTTT is pretty old school, and may be threatened by Shortcuts on iOS (I don’t keep up with the Android platform so I don’t know what the deal is over there). Shortcuts still has various limitations, though, so it isn’t quite obsolete yet.

This is another one I already had for other purposes, but [this applet](https://ifttt.com/applets/Pp5DH7sT-get-a-notification-reminder-to-put-on-sunscreen-when-the-uv-index-is-high) by Weather Underground to “Get a notification reminder to put on sunscreen when the UV index is high” is something I would recommend for anyone. It tells you when the UV index is 6 or higher, so that you’ll be sure to wear sunscreen. I wear sunscreen regardless, so I mostly think of it as a heads-up to take further precautions as necessary. Because… (continued in the next review)

&amp;#x200B;

**UV Index Widget**

* **Links:** [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1100568288) (free); one-time purchase or subscription-based pro version (hourly forecast downloads only available for latter)
* **Official description:** *UV Index Widget - Worldwide is a handy little app to check the current radiation level from the Sun (the UV Index), the highest UV Index forecast for today, and the forecasted UV Index for the next 7 days, anywhere on Earth. You can also add the UV Index to your Today Screen using the accompanying widget, set notifications for when the UV Radiation exceeds certain levels, and automatically add the UV levels to your Apple Health app.*
* **Frequency of use:** As often as any weather app; every day if you count glancing at the Today screen

I should probably start by disclosing that I suffer from sun allergy. I’m sure most people don’t need a seven-day hourly forecast for the UV index, but because of my specific problem, I find it very useful. It’s also useful to be able to swipe to my Today screen and see a diagram with the UV index graph for the day. I have to say the seven-day forecast can fluctuate quite a bit, though, so be aware of that.

&amp;#x200B;

**UVLens**

* **Links:** [Official website](https://www.uvlens.com) (where you can also check the UV index, from your browser), [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1060878359) (free), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spark64.uvlens.mobile) (free)
* **Official description:** *Exposure to sunlight’s ultraviolet radiation (UV) can damage your skin, cause sunburn and increase your risk of skin cancer. UVLens shows you when you need to take care and when you can safely enjoy the sun.*
* **Frequency of use:** Any time I’m outside

This one should be enough if you just want the UV index, without a widget or a bunch of forecasts like the app above. There’s also a sunscreen reapplication reminder, which I find useful, though I could arguably just set a normal timer on my phone too. You can set things like your skin type and activity level, though I have no idea how much these actually change the notifications in the app.

&amp;#x200B;

Also sun-sensitivity-related: **DMinder** ([official website](http://dminder.ontometrics.com), [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id547102495), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ontometrics.dminder)), which seems really useful, but I’ve been too lazy to use it properly. I really should, though, because I have a vitamin D deficiency, which I’m sure goes hand in hand with sun allergy. Basically it tracks your vitamin D levels as best you can without actually having your blood analyzed.

&amp;#x200B;

# ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS: AIR POLLUTION

As I mentioned, I live in Japan, and high levels of PM2.5 and Asian dust wreck my skin. There are specific products made to ward off these particles, so I would check these apps during certain times of the year to see whether I should be using them. These particles also make my eyes itch, so I’ll know whether it’s because of this or whether I should be looking for some other cause. Again, these can be looked up in heavy-duty weather apps, but it takes too many steps to get to the information I want.

&amp;#x200B;

**AirVisual Air Quality Forecast**

* **Links:** [Official website](https://www.airvisual.com/air-quality-app), [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1048912974) (free), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.airvisual) (free); direct download for Android (for users in China, it looks like)
* **Official description:** *The most trusted and reliable air quality information brought to you from the world’s leading air pollution data provider. Covering 10,000+ locations from a global network of government monitoring stations and AirVisual’s own validated sensors.*
* **Frequency of use:** As needed; pretty much never these days, but there are times when I use this every day

I find this to be pretty well-designed, and it’s always a major plus for me when the app looks good. The only reason why I also use the other app is because I have to tap on each day and scroll down to see the specific pollutants (although the photo on the official website suggests that might not be the case if you have 3D Touch – another limitation on the iPhone SE).

&amp;#x200B;

**大気汚染予報** (in Japanese only)

* **Links:** Official website, [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id631049880) (free), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.norikistudio.android.aerosol) (free)
* **Official description:** 九州大学応用力学研究所から提供されている「SPRINTARS」の予測（大気汚染粒子 PM2.5、黄砂 SPM）を、都道府県ごとの天気予報風に表示するアプリです。そのほか、環境省から提供されている「そらまめ君」の速報値を見ることもできます。データの取得方法に一工夫を加えることで、データ通信料とバッテリー消費量を低減しています。
* **Frequency of use:** Same as above

Not nearly as pretty as the other app, but it gives me a very straightforward presentation of the level of PM2.5 and Asian dust at different times of the day for today and tomorrow, and a forecast for five days after that, all in one screen. It also lists the weekly forecast for different areas of Japan (so it’s very Japan-specific, not sure whether it would be useful at all in other countries) in another screen, specific measurements in specific areas on another, and an animated map showing the movement of either PM2.5 or Asian dust in yet another. All in all, it’s a great way to check this information at a glance if you can read Japanese; you can probably also still use this even if you can’t read Japanese, if someone can tell you what’s what when you first download it.

&amp;#x200B;

# ONLINE RESOURCES (IN GENERAL)

I noticed in the thread I linked to at the beginning that some people were interpreting “apps” to include websites, which I definitely don’t think are the same thing, but figured it would be beneficial to include them in this post for that reason. While I’m reasonably sure there aren’t a whole lot of big app nerds who know all of the apps I just talked about, I imagine many of you will know more websites than I do, so this might not be as useful (or maybe none of it is, who knows).

Once again, please remember that it’s on each and every one of us to decide whether to trust any given source or not. I am neither scientifically inclined nor a beauty expert in any way.

&amp;#x200B;

# ONLINE RESOURCES: PRODUCTS

I also look for reviews on blogs, YouTube, Amazon, and Reddit, but besides that and/or if I don’t have time to do a lot of searching…

&amp;#x200B;

[**アットコスメ（＠ｃｏｓｍｅ）｜日本最大のコスメ・美容の総合サイト**](https://www.cosme.net) (in Japanese only – English version reviewed separately below)

@cosme claims to be and probably is Japan’s biggest website on cosmetics and other beauty products. I think I’ve had an account for something like 15 years, and have posted more than 90 reviews to date. Unfortunately it’s a great example of how poorly designed way too many Japanese websites are – it looks like it was made in 1999, which coincidentally is when the service started (according to [Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/@cosme)), and I actually don’t remember it ever looking any different. (Insert huge rant on Japanese web design here…)

But because it’s ancient, it has become a *massive* database for a ton of reviews by tons of different people with different skin types and in different age groups. I do like that they show this information next to each review, to give you a little bit of context. They also have a bunch of other things going on – blogs, Q&amp;As, articles, a retail version of the website – but I only ever look at it for the reviews and product overviews (the official press blurb and, usually, the launch date, which isn’t always easy to figure out).

So it’s useful in a lot of ways and I refer to it all the time in spite of the horrible design. THAT SAID. I do think that there are way too many incentivized reviews, though they do give you the option to filter out any reviews by people who didn’t buy the product. This totally skews the ratings and rankings, obviously. It also messes with the “sort by number of reviews” function, and it gets really annoying after a while as a whole, because there are just *so many* of them. You can read my full rant [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/c3ar7p/news_cosme_the_best_cosmetics_awards_midyear_2019/errqm3t/).

There are other similar websites/apps that are probably easier to use, but again, I’ve had an account for ages and sometimes it’s the only way for me to remember that I’ve used some product or another in the distant past.

&amp;#x200B;

[**@cosme is Japan's largest beauty and cosmetics portal site.**](https://us.cosme.net)

This is the English version of the website described above. It’s always so embarrassing when English versions of Japanese websites have these awkward sentences as titles… There’s tiny text at the bottom saying: *Our website is translated for audiences in Japan that understand English, regarding reviews, ranking and information for products sold in Japan.* Fortunately it’s nowhere near as cluttered as the Japanese version, but it looks really strangely bare-bones, like it’s still just a wireframe.

Do any of you actually use this? I had to enter a new user name (though the same one of the Japanese version worked), my gender, and date of birth all over again to use this website with the same account as the Japanese one. Which I only did just now, so I can’t actually tell you anything about it. The newest reviews I’ve seen so far are from 2017, but maybe the product information aspect could be useful. Again, I haven’t really looked at many of them yet.

This version of the website is also available in Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and Hangul. I can’t read those languages (not really, anyway) so I have no idea what the quality is like.

&amp;#x200B;

# ONLINE RESOURCES: INGREDIENTS

These are the websites I either referred to or considered referring to while working on my overwhelmingly obsessive spreadsheet’s ingredients sheet. I think Shiseido and Coop’s databases/dictionaries came up a few times when I was running searches for ingredients in Japanese, but I haven’t been using them actively, since most ingredient stuff tends to be easier for me to understand in English. But not always, so I may eventually end up adding information from Japanese sources too.

&amp;#x200B;

[**SkinCarisma**](https://www.skincarisma.com)

I really like the idea of SkinCarisma. There’s *a lot* of information for *a lot* of products, even some Japanese ones, and that potential overload of information is organized extremely well. I like that they show EWG hazard scores and CIR findings rather than just one or the other. I was very impressed as a whole – until I tried looking up one of my favorite products, [Allie Extra UV Gel](https://www.skincarisma.com/products/allie/extra-uv-gel-spf50-pa), and found a really obvious mistake: I love this sunscreen and all, but it most definitely is NOT alcohol-free. The list of ingredients says ethanol, not ethanolamine. SkinCarisma also skips over triethylhexanoin, and lists Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer instead of Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, EDTA instead of Disodium EDTA, and Hyaluronic Acid instead of Sodium Hyaluronate (or maybe some of these are actually interchangeable – I’m not qualified to say). Also, BHT has a score of 4, not 6, [according to the EWG’s own database](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/700741/BHT/), but maybe that was updated after the data was entered on SkinCarisma or something.

At first I thought maybe the list is for an older formulation, but I’m pretty sure it’s contained alcohol for as long as I can remember, based on how it smells. Maybe this is a fluke and they just had some problems with this particular product, but I would be sure to compare the list with the official list of ingredients, just in case.

I really do like how they organize the information, though, and it’s making me consider adding new columns to my spreadsheet. (When will it end… Oh, right, probably when I don’t have time any more.)

&amp;#x200B;

[**CosDNA**](http://www.cosdna.com)

I learned about this website through this community. It’s available in English, Japanese, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified Chinese; I’m assuming the Japanese version is the original, based on the length of the FAQ pages. It seems like a popular criticism is that there’s absolutely no information about their sources. For what it’s worth, [the Japanese FAQ page](http://www.cosdna.com/jpn/help/ingredients_qna.php) says the ratings are based on CIR, RTECS, and FDA data, as well as DERMAdoctor, Sage Advice, Skin Deep, [biodizionario.it](https://biodizionario.it), and publications by experts around the world. See link for more details (in Japanese). I’ve found multiple results for the same product before, though, and I find it a little confusing in general.

So, I’m sure it’s a great resource for a lot of people, especially if you don’t have time to look up all the ingredients yourself and/or you can’t find a list of ingredients anywhere else, but I think I’ll stick to working on my mega-spreadsheet.

&amp;#x200B;

[**EWG’s Skin Deep Cosmetics Database**](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/)

The EWG has been called into question by multiple people who would know better than I do (examples [here](https://chemistscorner.com/why-the-ewg-skin-deep-database-is-still-a-dubious-source/) and [here](https://www.acsh.org/news/2017/05/25/dear-ewg-why-real-scientists-think-poorly-you-11323), Reddit discussion with arguments for both sides [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupRehab/comments/7vi9gf/psa_for_researching_cosmetics_ingredients/)), and I’m careful not to read too much into the ratings, but it’s still a convenient resource. I don’t interpret high hazard scores as ingredients to avoid, but rather as an indication that I might want to read up on it a bit, just in case. I’m really not informed enough to catch real problems with the database, beyond there being any hazard scores at all for ingredients with “None” for the data it’s based on, but I *have* come across listings where the information is given in a confusingly inconsistent manner, like colorants.

One complaint I have after looking up a billion ingredients is that I wish the dropdown menu wouldn’t keep fluttering down and covering the search box every time I accidentally move my cursor over it.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Ingredients | Cosmetic Ingredient Review**](https://www.cir-safety.org/ingredients)

Basically the CIR equivalent of the EWG database above. It pretty much links you to PDFs with research related to the ingredient. I would read them if I really was trying to learn about a specific ingredient, but for the purpose of my mega-spreadsheet, I cheated and just looked at…

&amp;#x200B;

[**CIR Findings | Cosmetic Ingredient Review**](https://www.cir-safety.org/cir-findings)

The “Quick Reference Table” includes all of the ingredients in one PDF. The key is on the bottom of the very last page: *S - safe in the present practices of use and concentration SQ - safe for use in cosmetics, with qualifications I - the available data are insufficient to support safety Z - the available data are insufficient to support safety, but the ingredient is not used U - the ingredient is unsafe for use in cosmetics UNS - ingredients for which the data are insufficient and their use in cosmetics is not supported*. You’re welcome.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Cosmetic-Info.jp：化粧品の成分表示名称 検索条件入力**](https://www.cosmetic-info.jp/jcln/search.php)

This is essential for the bilingual part of my mega-spreadsheet. You can search by either the official Japanese ingredient name or the INCI name, and other more advanced settings that I haven’t needed to use yet. If this database is wrong, my spreadsheet is pretty much fucked. It could potentially be of use even if you can’t read Japanese; copy and paste the Japanese ingredient name in the first text field and hit enter.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Ingredient Dictionary | Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary | Paula's Choice**](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary)

I’m sure there are certain things that would need to be taken with a grain of salt here too, especially because this is on the website of a particular cosmetics brand, but it’s convenient and easier to understand than actual studies (I’m not science-literate, sue me).

&amp;#x200B;

[**INCIDecoder - Decode your skincare ingredients**](https://incidecoder.com)

I haven’t actually used this yet, but it looks like it might be useful. Basically you can look up ingredients by their INCI names, and it gives you a breakdown in plain English.

&amp;#x200B;

# ONLINE RESROUCES: INGREDIENTS – UV FILTERS

As I mentioned, I have sun allergy and the spreadsheet started out with sunscreens.

&amp;#x200B;

[**BASF Sun Care Portfolio – UV Filters**](https://www.eurotradingonline.it/focus/sun-care/guida-completa-filtri-uv-basf/) (click on the button to download PDF)

This is what I looked at, but I really wish I could find a resource of this nature on BASF’s own website. Or so I was about to say, except I *just* found…

&amp;#x200B;

[**Products | BASF's Care Creations**](https://www.carecreations.basf.com/product-formulations/products/)

I’m definitely going to go through and check up on all the UV filters listed here. How exciting!! (I really do have problems.) BASF is, by the way, “a German chemical company and the largest chemical producer in the world” ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASF)).

&amp;#x200B;

[**The Lab Muffin Guide to Basic Skincare – Lab Muffin Beauty Science**](https://labmuffin.com/lab-muffin-guide-basic-skincare/)

There’s a really great, easy-to-understand table with information about each UV filter in Lab Muffin’s e-book. The free sample PDF also includes this table. Lab Muffin is a science educator with a PhD in chemistry, who also runs [a blog](https://labmuffin.com) and [a YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/labmuffinbeautyscience).

&amp;#x200B;

[**UV Filters Chart: Sunscreen Active Ingredients | Skinacea.com**](http://www.skinacea.com/sunscreen/uv-filters-chart.html#.XQ9f1i2B0mo)

This one’s very detailed too – except I got a little confused about the maximum percentage. It’s not for the US because it includes non-FDA-approved filters, but it’s not for Europe either, because it also includes PABA, which they state is banned in Europe. Maybe it’s for Canada or Australia? [The About page](http://www.skinacea.com/about.html) for the website didn’t tell me anything about this either. If anyone knows, do tell.

&amp;#x200B;

Plus other random pages I found while searching for each UV filter, because I definitely put in more effort here than I did for other ingredients.

&amp;#x200B;

289,AsianBeauty,Review of Korean Sunscreens by Saerom Min (Founder of Romand),"Hello! I wanted to share this video by Saerom Min, a Korean Youtuber. She's the founder/owner of the brand Romand, which I've seen mentioned here and there on this subreddit. I made a similar post on /r/muacjdiscussion under a now deleted account lol. Realized I was posting too much personal info on that one, so I nuked it to start fresh.

I'll be summarizing the video through bullet points, otherwise I'll be repeating the phrases ""She says"" or ""Saerom says"" way too many times. So please remember that nothing I translate reflects my opinion. I'll be sharing my own opinion in a separate comment after publishing this post.

Link to video: https://youtu.be/rHHxqyrUZzk

Video Introduction: Snippets of what the video, talking about how important sunscreen is, etc. She used the sunscreens she's about to recommend for as short as a month for some and up to years for others. There are different types of sunscreens, so she will also talk about the best way to apply each kind. Her criteria for judging the sunscreens are: SPF, ease of application, how naturally the sunscreen sits on her skin, how well the sunscreen interacts with foundation. Says she will specify when a sunscreen is good to use under foundation.

Onto the sunscreens!

**Hera Sun Mate Stick** [picture of product](https://imgur.com/Ll6G94r)

* SPF 50+/PA++++
* This is the stick version of the [Hera Sun Mate Daily](https://imgur.com/F3sqhcv), which she used way back during her blogging years for over 10 years. Probably used over 10 bottles.
* Best stick sunscreen she's used
* Only has been using it for a month, but has [used this much already](https://imgur.com/Rw7ypxQ)
* Smooth application and very lightweight
* Matte finish
* [Left side is without product applied, right side with product applied](https://imgur.com/B4kb4nR)
* Apparently has this thing where she hates the feeling of any kind of product (lotion, foundation, etc.) on her hands, but doesn't have that problem with this sunscreen because no stickiness is left behind.
* Feels like you've applied nothing.
* Rather than using it before makeup, better to use all-day when you're going bare-faced and you'll be outside a lot.
* Application method: Swipe on and then tap with fingers.
* Random bit about how her boyfriend thought the sunscreen was a case for AirPods.
* Because this isn't a product you apply with your hands, you may miss some spots if you aren't careful. 
* Application method in detail: Apply stick from inside your face to outside in one motion. Don't do swiping motions, or it'll increase your chances of missing a spot. Don't swipe back and forth. Swipe in one direction (inside to outside). Be careful around nose area, as it is easy to miss a spot. 
* Same applies for when you apply on your neck (swipe in one, uninterrupted direction, top to bottom)
* Tap product in with fingers. Fingers also come in handy to check if you missed a spot. Make sure to blend into hairline as well.
* Method for reapplication: First blot oil/dust on your face with tissue. If you don't, dust from your face could get onto the stick, and that's not good. Then repeat application method described above.
* This product is great because it doesn't feel heavy at all when you reapply. Doesn't leave bits behind as you apply it. Really feels like you haven't applied anything. 

**Goodal Green Tangerine Vita C Dark Spot Tone Up Cream** [picture of product](https://imgur.com/i3C8Sua)

* SPF 50+/PA++++
* This product is actually a product placement! However, even if she didn't get the offer, she would have recommended this product anyway.
* This product is actually marketed as a tone-up cream rather than a sunscreen.
* Applies like a lotion.
* Tones up the face naturally (which in Korean means like brightening)
* [Left side is without product applied, right side is with product applied](https://imgur.com/5JNadVC)
* Instead of making your face white and chalky, it makes your skin seem brighter and clearer.
* There are lots of tone-up creams that apply like a light lotion, but most of them do not have SPF. This product has the best of both worlds.
* As a makeup brand owner and as someone who sells tone-up creams (among other products of course), she knows that adding SPF to tone-up creams makes it lose its ease of application, but this product as the best of both worlds.
* So this product accomplishes three things: tone-up, moisturizing makeup base, sun protection. Can decrease the amount of products you use before/during makeup.
* She uses this product either bare-faced with a natural tone-up, or underneath makeup. Application method differs for both.
* Bare-faced: She uses her left hand for the right side of her face and vice-versa. Reason: The angle allows you to apply the product more thoroughly this way. 
* Applies [this much](https://imgur.com/OfGdOCe) on the back of her hand.
* Applies [this much](https://imgur.com/bx3wbK3) on her right cheek and uses her left hand to spread/rub product in, blending down to neck.
* Tap product in to prevent it from pilling/moving around.
* Same for left side of face, but using right hand.
* Apply inside to outside for forehead, blending into hairline.
* Lightly tap into under eye area (since that area has weaker/thinner skin)
* Make sure to tap well around nose area so product doesn't pile up around the sides.
* [Before and after.](https://imgur.com/jifP0rb) Natural tone-up.
* For areas you'd like extra protection on, or for areas you'd like to bring forward (highlight), add another layer, but be careful. It's a tone-up cream so applying too much can wash you out.
* [She applies on forehead, bridge of nose, tops of cheeks](https://imgur.com/4XdKFd1)
* Instead of rubbing, tap in product. Products like this (that are like light lotions) are good for layering because they don't end up caking up.
* Application method for underneath foundation: Basically the same as the bare-faced method but *a lot* more tapping around so that it doesn't cake up with your foundation, especially around nose area. 
* She uses a liquid foundation for this video. Dots the foundation from inside her face to the outside and prefers a sponge over a brush.
* Press in with sponge. Result will look good (non-cakey) and last longer.
* Went on vacation to some hot country and tested this sunscreen with her makeup. Obviously her foundation didn't look 100% the same at the end of the night as it did when she first applied, but the foundation wore nicely and didn't break apart weirdly. 

**Krave Beauty Beet The Sun** [picture of product](https://imgur.com/ZfO4UKl)

* SPF 50+/PA++++
* Clarifies this video has nothing to do with Krave Beauty creator Liah Yoo. Saerom simply enjoys this sunscreen and is on her 2nd or 3rd bottle. Her mother enjoys it, too.
* Product itself reminds her of condensed milk. Liquidy and transparent. No tone-up at all. 
* [Left side is without product applied, right side is with product applied](https://imgur.com/MEuEMbO)
* Label on back of product claims it's light, fresh-feeling, and isn't oily. But in Saerom's experience, it doesn't feel that fresh and she feels slightly oily as time passes with it on.
* HOWEVER, the reason she is recommending it is because it works with foundation so well, especially with long-lasting, matte foundations like Estee Lauder Double Wear. Doing so cancels out the negatives of each product. 
* Says Double Wear applies more nicely with Beet the Sun. [Before and after with Double Wear](https://imgur.com/JTcciJe)
* In the summer, people tend to prefer long-lasting, matte foundations like ELDW. Beet the Sun really works well with foundations like ELDW.
* Slight tangent about SPF in foundations. (I don't think it's relevant to this post, so gonna leave it out. Will translate if anyone is curious)
* Beet the Sun helps you apply heavier foundation so it sits on your skin nicely without caking up.
* Application with makeup: [Start with about this much](https://imgur.com/LU1cKVT). Apply on face like she did with the Goodal sunscreen. Make sure to tap product in well before putting on foundation.
* Says you look dewy/moisturized rather than oily after application. [Here's a pic](https://imgur.com/271bsew)
* Likes that it isn't very sticky. 
* Next: Applying ELDW. [Start with about this much](https://imgur.com/dlBldWE) because ELDW has such high coverage.
* [Dot on face like so](https://imgur.com/ZPm0B7t). Her tool of choice for this is those cushions that come in cushion foundations.
* ELDW sets quickly, so dot and work and on each part of your face instead of dotting all over first.
* Make sure to start with only a little product or it can cake up. She then puts on another layer of foundation and applies in the same method.
* For those who avoid foundations like ELDW because they seem too heavy/cakey: Using a sunscreen like Beet the Sun and applying minimal product in light layers can be helpful, especially during the summer.
* [Result of Beet the Sun + ELDW](https://imgur.com/U8xCbhl)

**Shingmulnara Oxygen Water Face &amp; Body Sun Cushion** [picture of product](https://imgur.com/96S13ZT)

* SPF 50+/PA+++
* It's [bigger than most cushions](https://imgur.com/xJiURzr), so the mirror in it is also bigger. Convenient for touching up on the go.
* Product is soaked in the sponge inside the compact. [Here is a picture.](https://imgur.com/q8L8Wxd)
* It is a physical sunscreen, so leaves a slight white cast, but not as bad as other sunscreens. [Left side is without product applied. Right side is with product applied.](https://imgur.com/S8iv1H5)
* Personally doesn't use physical sunscreens because they break down weirdly on her face, but this sunscreen seems to disappear rather than break down.
* She only uses this when she is going barefaced. Does not work well with foundation.
* She's recommending it because it's so convenient to use the days she's going barefaced. Easy to apply because size of cushion, doesn't cake up upon reapplication, and, as mentioned, disappears with time rather than breaking down on her face.
* Word of caution: Cushions in general pick up a lot less product than, for example, squeezing out sunscreen from a tube. So she really does not recommend it for when you'll be outdoors for a long time.
* She personally uses this sunscreen when she knows she will be barefaced the whole day. Uses it before leaving house, once more at lunchtime, once more before leaving work to go home. Says again that despite multiple reapplications, product doesn't cake up.
* Overall just a comfortable product to use.
* Emphasizes again that she does not recommend this product if you'll be out in the sun for long periods of time, like if you're going to the beach.
* Because of how big the cushion is, it might seem like you can apply the sunscreen more quickly. However, it's precisely because of the size of the cushion that it could be hard to apply the sunscreen thoroughly. So be careful that you're not missing any spots.
* When she's doing makeup tutorials with cushion foundations, she always says to make sure to go over your whole face with just one press into the cushion. With cushion sunscreens, however, that's way too little product. 
* So for this product, she'll press into the cushion, cover one part of her face, and press into the cushion again before moving onto a different part of her face.

293,AsianBeauty,Fermented Rice Hair Products??,"So we all know how great fermented rice products are for your skin, but I'm interested in the benefits for  scalp and hair. According to [an article](https://theklog.co/rice-water/) on Klog, "" A [**scientific study in 2010**](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2010.00605_3.x/abstract)  revealed that washing hair with rice water decreased surface friction and increased elasticity, resulting in hair that stayed stronger and healthier for longer. "" Personally, I love using fermented rice products on my face. The Kuramoto bijin hakumai ferment sake kasu lotion is maybe one of the more transformative AB products I've used, but I digress. Apparently there is a long history of the fermented rice water being used as a hair rinse. Geisha's would bathe in sake, and the Yao women of China rinse their hair in fermented rice water. I've gone down a bit of a rabbit hole when diving into the topic of ""rice wine for hair"" ...I figured it was time to  turn to reddit. So here's the discussion:

&amp;#x200B;

What do you know about using Rice Ferment Filtrate on hair?

Do you know of any AB shampoos containing Rice Ferment Filtrate?

&amp;#x200B;

Wacky side note: Im much too lazy to be fermenting my own rice water once a week for a hair rinse, so I'm considering rinsing my hair in nigori sake once a week.  Can anyone foresee this having some sort of catastrophic effect on my hair?

294,AsianBeauty,Skin thickness?,"Hi there,

I heard that depending on how thick your skin is, your products can absorb more or less better. Also, oily skin people are more prone to have thicker skin too. Is that true? For all the people out there with thick skin, how can you know for sure that your skin is thick ? Does your products hardly absorb or something similar ? How do you take of it knowing that ? 


For my own case, sometime I feel like my skin is so thick that even a layer of toner doesnt fully absorb into it. All my moisturizers just sit on my face and I can remain sticky and greasy for hours it just wont fully absorb. Is it actually the cast for everyone with oily skin ?",t3_c3y9lq
295,AsianBeauty,Can anyone help to dissect this article?,"Admittedly this article is not really AB related but this sub is the best I know of in terms of knowledge of chemicals applicable to skincare &amp; beauty. So apologies beforehand if it's not appropriate.

So I got shown this article by a relative: https://amp.businessinsider.com/dangerous-chemicals-in-beauty-products-makeup-list-2019-6 

I kind of can tell that this article has a lot of fearmongering components. For example the section on parabens doesn't really have much fact to support the headline. And I do remember reading somewhere on this sub about asbestos in cosmetics. Do also remember learning about sulfates in shampoos somewhere in this sub.

But for the other chemicals...I can't quite put a finger to why/in what way are they inaccurate. Will appreciate if someone can help explain?

303,AsianBeauty,Pony Effects Haul!! (Mini Review),"Saw a Pony Effects display and went a little ham :c And it didn't help that the packaging was just so sleek and gorgeous, black and gold gets me every time. But I can't say I regret it.

Mini reviews for those I've tried out!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. Pony Effect **Radiance Glow Hydrating Starter**

very brightening! lightweight, faintly shimmery; personally i think it's quite hydrating. apart from giving the face a dewy sort of glow, i can't say for sure if it does anything for makeup or its staying power. blends out into colourlessness.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Pony Effect **Seamless Foundation** in *Rose Ivory*

surprisingly not that matte on me! maybe semi, but i do like a glow. very pretty, light and smooth, has good general coverage. may work best for those with dry skin, i think.

&amp;#x200B;

Pony Effect **Defense Longwear Cushion Foundation** in *Fair*

haven't tried it :c

&amp;#x200B;

3. Pony Effect **Grind Sparkling Shadow** in *Pregame*

haven't tried it :c

&amp;#x200B;

4. Pony Effect **Conceptual Quad** in *Be Romantic*

a little sheer, but smooth and buildable and blendable and oh so pretty. the shimmers were especially gorgeous. very little fall-out for me, fairly long-lasting with a primer as far as i can see.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Pony Effect **Outfit Lipstick** in *Waltz Step*

the formula for both *waltz step* and *my heritage* are very similar; very buttery, smooth, they apply easily and give good pigmentation in one coat, or more if you'd like it thicker; or if you're like me and like to pat it on, *my heritage* especially gives a gorgeous blotted look. the finish is velvety and smooth, somewhat matte but not drying at all. the colours are absolutely beautiful though; *waltz step* is especially bright, but both are extremely eye-catching. the caps are magnetic by the way!!

&amp;#x200B;

6. Pony Effect **Velvet Outfit Lipstick** in *My Heritage*

see above!

&amp;#x200B;

7. Pony Effect **Favourite Fluid Lip Tint** in *Cherished Values*

(far left, gold tube)

lip swatchhes only so far, so i can't be sure for the staying power, but it's smooth, lightweight but somehow has an almost gel or jellylike texture? it's very bright and quite pretty though i found it a little sheer with one coat. it leaves a light, pretty stain though!

&amp;#x200B;

8. Pony Effect **Enamellic Glossy Lip** in *03 Orange Glaze, 06 Hazel Varnish, 08 Frosted Peony*

(black tubing, left to right as 03, 08, 06)

lip swatches only so far, so again i can't say anything for the staying power (although i imagine it's as transferrable as any other gloss), but it goes on so smooth and blends well if you're going for a gradient lip, and isn't sticky at all for me\~ they're very pretty, and very shiny.

&amp;#x200B;

9. Pony Effect **Stayfit Matte Lip Colour** in *On Point, Exquisite, Incredible, Fantastic*

(coloured tubing, left to right as fantastic, incredible, exquisite, on point)

*on point, exquisite*, and *incredible* all have a beautiful, silky, thin formula, a one-coat sort of pigmentation. the colours are gorgeous too, although *on point* and *exquisite* are colours i'm personally not very used to. but *fantastic* though... the colour is beautiful, but the formula is a nightmare? i just can't seem to get it to work :c it's streaky, patchy, doesn't build... idk what to do. they're all very creamy and comfortable, though, and dry down pretty quick. it lasts well on my lips as far as i can tell and doesn't transfer, but may need reapplication especially if you're eating. if you have dry lips, i suggest prepping them first!

&amp;#x200B;

Total came to about USD400 (converted).

If you guys have tried out any of her other products and like them, please do recommend them to me! c:

306,AsianBeauty,[Discussion] Evening out uneven hooded Asian eyelids?,"Hello all,

I've seen a few posts here and there about evening out eyelids, usually for cases where folks have one double eyelid and one mono or hooded eyelid.  I heard about using eyelid tape consistently to help even out the eyelid, as suggested [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3gwx58/my_permanent_uneven_eyelid_fix_worked_for_me_and/) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7myHS2rZMcg).

Has anyone had this experience specifically with uneven hooded eyelids?  That is, you have the same kind of hooded lid on both eyes, but one fold is deeper on one eye than the other, resulting in uneven eyes.  Here's a photo of my eyes to illustrate:

I want to ask all of you who purchases from  Jolse.com to send them emails asking them to secure their website. 

Please comment if you agree. Please send them a link to this reddit so they know this is a huge consumer concern. If they want their customers to be happy, they should protect our information. 

In today’s age, with increasing frequency of cyber crime incidents, identity theft, ransomware, etc... there is no reason for a website with so many users to not have basic protection. It’s just a cost of doing business. Businesses have to be held accountable for protecting consumer privacy. 

Moderators, please don’t delete this post. Jolse.com is mentioned so often in this reddit as recommendations for AB purchases, but people don’t mention that it’s not secured.

314,AsianBeauty,[Discussion] Let's talk about the concentration of Centella Asiatica/Madecassoside in our favorite Cica products,"Hi everyone.

I'm in the process of researching Centella Asiatica products to add to my routine. Specifically, I'm looking for the Madecassoside component of Centella Asiatica, and even more specifically, at least a 0.1% concentration of it.

There have been a couple studies indicating 0.1% Madecassoside promotoes collagen synthesis (type III) and is anti-inflammatory.

Here are some products I'm considering: Etude House Soon Jung Relief Toner, Etude House Soon Jung Panthensoside Cica Balm, A'pieu Cica Gel, A'Pieu Cica Fluid, and A'pieu Cica Cream.

I know the A'Pieu Cica Cream contains 0.1% Madecassoside, but I'm not crazy about the essential oils in it 🤐

I think the A'Pieu Cica Gel contains 0.5% Madecassoside, but it looks like I would have to order from SK. And I kinda learned my lesson not to do that because I'm extremely impatient ((if I do decide to do this, which vendor has the fastest shipping between YesStyle, RoseRose, or IAmLove on eBay?))

The ingredients list for both Etude House products is pretty impressive because Madecassoside is really high up on the ingredients list, but it's so hard to say. In the toner, the Madecassoside comes right after Panthenol, which is used in concentrations of 1-5% according to Lotioncrafter. So I would think the Madecassoside would be at least 0.1% but again, hard to say.

Any thoughts?

Update: Thanks everyone for your feedback!! I ended up ordering from sweetcorea on eBay. Thanks to all of you who suggested I wait for the international shipping. In this particular case, that was the best option because the only US option was Missha's US website, where the product cost $27.50. I paid $15 ish through sweetcorea. There were a couple cheaper options ($11 and up) but sweetcorea seems favored on this sub (I did a search.)",t3_c32tsq

324,AsianBeauty,[REVIEW] Etude House UV Double Cut Fresh Gel SPF 50+/PA++++,"I rarely see this sunscreen being talked about on this sub and it breaks my heart! I feel so happy with my purchase that I decided to write an in-depth review. I was recently on the hunt for a new sunscreen because I got too tired looking up which reformulations of Biore Watery Essence were good and I honestly preferred something Korean (I’m Korean so it’s easier for me to look up information and Korean products tend to arrive faster in Canada than Japanese products imo).

&amp;#x200B;

**Skin Type:** Slightly oily but dehydrated, flaky around my mouth. I’m on tretinoin 0.025 which I use every 2-3 nights.

**Skin Tone:** Fair-medium, I wear a no. 21 in terms of Korean foundations.

&amp;#x200B;

While this sunscreen is touted as being a gel, it looks like a lotion at first glance. It is white and appears creamy in the tube. However, it spreads on my skin completely colourless and does not feel heavy. This sunscreen appears to be completely chemical and contains no zinc or physical sunscreens, so I imagine this is why there is no white cast. It is slightly thicker than Biore Watery Essence, but still sits very light on the skin. For that reason, I think this might be good for people with dry skin who like the finish of Biore but want something less drying. (Biore lists alcohol as its second ingredient, while Etude House lists alcohol as its fourth ingredient.)

&gt;**Ingredients:** WATER, ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE, HOMOSALATE, ALCOHOL, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE, DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE, ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE, SILICA, NIACINAMIDE, CAPRYLYL METHICONE, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, DIMETHICONE/VINYL DIMETHICONE CROSSPOLYMER, AMMONIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE/VP COPOLYMER, PROPANEDIOL, SACCHARIDE HYDROLYSATE, OCTYLDODECANOL, ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, TROMETHAMINE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, ADENOSINE, HYDROXYPROPYL METHYLCELLULOSE STEAROXY ETHER, CENTELLA ASIATICA EXTRACT, PORTULACA OLERACEA EXTRACT, HOUTTUYNIA CORDATA EXTRACT, CURCUMA LONGA (TURMERIC) ROOT EXTRACT, ECHIUM PLANTAGINEUM SEED OIL, SALVIA HISPANICA SEED EXTRACT, ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF EXTRACT, BAMBUSA VULGARIS WATER, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL UNSAPONIFIABLES, CARDIOSPERMUM HALICACABUM FLOWER/LEAF/VINE EXTRACT, GLYCERIN, PHENOXYETHANOL, ETHYL HEXANEDIOL, IRIS FLORENTINA ROOT EXTRACT, CHAMOMILLA RECUTITA (MATRICARIA) FLOWER/LEAF EXTRACT, TOCOPHEROL, FRAGRANCE

As you can see from the ingredients list, there is a ton of good stuff in the latter half of the list including niacinamide, adenosine, centella, aloe, and a bunch of other extracts. We all know that all this might not mean much if there’s only 0.000001% of it in there, but I do feel like my skin is calm and happy with this product. With Biore, I never broke out or became dry but I also felt like my skin was… chemically? And for some reason, while Biore dried down to a lighter sheen I also found myself more oily in the afternoon compared to Etude House. I guess my dehydrated skin was over-compensating for the drier finish. There is fragrance in this gel, but I don’t particularly notice any scent. If there is one, it’s unoffensive to say the least.

&amp;#x200B;

I am prone to acne, hence the tretinoin, but I don’t think I clog too easily. I have never broken out with this product, but YMMV if you have more acne-prone skin than I do. Also, this sunscreen is not sweat or waterproof, but it’s perfect if you’re sitting by a window all day or it’s not too humid where you’re located.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently went to Korea and Etude House had BOGO sales for ALL their sunscreens. You bet I stocked up and got my family some sun protection gifts! I bought 2 jumbo sized tubes (150 mL) for 25,000 won or around 23 USD and 2 regular sized tubes (50 mL) for 12,000 won or around 10 USD. It is priced more expensively online, but it’s cheaper than Biore for me on eBay shipping to Canada.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, this is the perfect sunscreen for me :) Please consider this if you’re on the hunt for a sunscreen.",t3_c2m7a6

329,AsianBeauty,Mini reviews of 5 Kose Suncut SPF50+ PA++++ sunscreens,"(These sunscreens are not categorically different from one another, but I hope this writeup is helpful for anyone wanting to know about distinctions between Suncut sunscreens!)

&amp;#x200B;

[I've come to really like Suncut.](https://imgur.com/S6XZzuW) The texture of their UV gels and essences has always been great. And pretty important to me, Suncut tends to be wallet-friendly without much flashiness; these were all ¥500-800 (after tax) at my local drugstore or Amazon Japan. Their formulations include nice ingredients like botanical extracts, squalane, hyaluronic acid, etc., but it's not strongly (well?) advertised.

&amp;#x200B;

Swatch pics ([Full album here](https://imgur.com/a/ar29G5z). No rhyme or reason for which ones I photographed together):

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Suncut Aqualy UV Protect Gel** (160g light blue bottle).

My go-to in the past year for body sunscreen, as it comes in a larger bottle. No white cast detected on either East Asian or Caucasian skin, despite the cream being yellow-tinted and opaque.

Package notes: *Removes with soap. Can be used as a makeup base. No added fragrance. Formulated with hyaluronic acid and 10 types of botanical extracts.*

&amp;#x200B;

2. **Suncut Tone Up UV Essence** (80g purple tube).

""Tone-correcting"" sunscreen with a similar package design to Skin Aqua's Tone Up. I feel the lavender tint would be more flattering on pink-toned skin than on my yellow-toned skin (and probably wouldn't work well for darker skin tones in general).  I also wouldn't recommend this for uneven skin or people with beards, since it will be harder to get the coverage right.

There is of course a white cast that leaves a glowy pearliness on my skin, no matter how thoroughly I blend it in. I prefer matte finishes, so I wouldn't buy this again, but since the cream is thick and waterproof, staying power throughout the day feels stronger than the regular Perfect Gel above. Would consider buying a green-toned version (Skin Aqua makes one, but as far as I know it's not part of Suncut's lineup yet).

Package notes: *Removes with soap. Waterproof. Instagram glow. Tone up the entire body.*

&amp;#x200B;

3. **Suncut UV Perfect Gel Super Waterproof in Sakura &amp; Peach** (100g pink bottle).

I hoped this would have a subtle fruity scent (think: AB shampoos). The package noted a ""fuwari""/light fragrance, but it's just... strongly floral. I don't see Japanese customers especially being a fan of the strong fragrance.

Texture is great, more translucent and gel-like than the Perfect Gel above. No white cast.

The whole point of this sunscreen is the fragrance, but I personally didn't like the smell.

Package notes: *Removes with soap. Super waterproof. Can be used as a makeup base. Light fragrance. Formulated with collagen, squalane, hyaluronic acid and 10 types of botanical extracts.*

&amp;#x200B;

4. **Suncut UV Perfect Gel Super Waterproof** (100g yellow bottle).

My favorite of the bunch. Texture is nearly identical to the scented version above: translucent, absorbs quickly, not liquidy or drippy feeling. I think the consistency is comparable to **Nivea's Sun Protect Water Gel** (though it's been a few years since I used that one). No fragrance detected, just a mild alcohol smell that goes away quickly.

Package notes: *Removes with soap. Super waterproof; resists sweat and water. Protects skin against environmental irritants like pollen and dust. Can be used as a makeup base. Formulated with collagen, squalane, hyaluronic acid, 10 types of botanical extracts, and ""sarasara keep powder"" (to retain smoothness?).*

&amp;#x200B;

5. **Suncut UV Protect Gel Water Splash** (100g gradient blue bottle).

Same as above, but contains menthol. It's a great idea for summer, but the mintiness is practically undetectable. Again, no fragrance except for the alcohol smell, which is strong but fades within seconds.

Package notes: *Removes with soap. Can be used as a makeup base. No added fragrance. Formulated with hyaluronic acid and 10 types of botanical extracts.*

&amp;#x200B;

344,AsianBeauty,I tried Skin Aqua Tone Up UV Essence Mint Green,"I want to start by saying I’m mostly a lurker and haven’t done reviews in the past, but this one I bought when it came out a couple weeks ago and wanted to share my novice opinion. Also, I’m on mobile, not sure what that does to format here but I see many people apologize for it, so forgive me if there’s some weird formatting. Also, I’m doing this off the cuff and being inexperienced with reviews, it may be all over the place. 


I’ve had a few days to try this out and so far I really like it! I rarely leave the house in more than sunscreen and mascara, though I do love my skincare and am working on getting better at using products daily. I’m turning 40 this year with average to dry pale skin, with a lot of pink in my face. 


What I like about this sunscreen: it’s 80g, which is much more substantial than my favorite sunscreen, the UV Super Moisture Milk (40ml). I like the tube as well, I can easily tell when I’m running low so I don’t have to worry about running out before I can get it shipped from Japan (I’m in the US). 


I absolutely love that it really corrects my pink skin, while moisturizing and providing sun protection. I can throw this on and leave the house looking much better than I did before applying it. I can splash a toner on, wait for that to dry a little, and apply it over and feel even better. So far it has worked well over other moisturizers, I’ve only had the chance to try a few. I did apply foundation (I’m a total novice though) and it worked well over it. Both my MAC and Wet N Wild Foto Focus worked well with light application. 


What I’m unsure about: it goes on with a cast that dries pretty clear if you work it in well. Of course it’s tone correcting so it should have some cast. When I first got it, I saw it at my front step on my way to work and hastily applied it in my car. I had a few spots that went on too thick and could see those later on. My fault, if I apply it correctly and work it in, it doesn’t do that (I loved that the super moisture milk didn’t require a mirror to apply).  


I feel like it could pill slightly with certain moisturizers. I feel like the lighter the moisturizer, the better to apply this over. 


Overall, I will be using the two tubes I bought as everyday sunscreen for now. I’m really happy with my results on the color correction. I’d post pictures but I’m awful at that!

348,AsianBeauty,What are your favorite (and least favorite) products for fighting humidity in the summer? (Particularly for oily skin + hair),"Here’s the thing. I get up in the morning. I wash my face. I moisturize. I apply a mattifying sunscreen (Etude House Sunprise Airy Finish). I use a mattifying primer (J.one jelly pack). I apply a bit of BB cream with SPF (Mizon) and powder (Etude House Zero Sebum) with a brush. I use dry shampoo (Drybar) on my bangs as a preventative measure even if they’re clean, as well as an anti-humidity hairspray (Oribe). I I apply like 3 layers of antiperspirant because I do not have the luxury of going without (lol). I think I’m basically doing everything right. 

And then I walk 5 minutes to the subway from my NYC apartment, and by the time I get underground I’m a melty puddle of goo. Maybe that’s an exaggeration but I get on the train and whip out my blotting papers and try to fix my sweaty hairline, only to repeat this process several times a day until I give up...

For those similarly afflicted, let us commiserate and share product faves and least faves, including but not limited to:

- makeup (primer, powder, bb cream, foundation, setting spray, etc)
- sunscreen (face and body)
- face products (I’m always interested in moisturizers for those of us who are a little bit too “dewy”)
- hair products (scalp treatments, finishing products, dry shampoos, anything you do to keep it fresh)

I hate wasting precious products on my hands, and I feel that it gives me more even coverage with my sunscreen. I work in quadrants of my face. I apply the product to the sponge, dot it several times over the area, then pat pat pat until it is evenly applied. This also keeps me from me pulling on my skin from rubbing. There isn't a ton of info on the interwebs about it.

I'm looking at their other sunscreen with a higher SPF of 50++ but I want to try other brands as well. I have heard good things about Biore UV Rich Aqua, Skin Aqua UV super moisture milk, or La Roche-Posay (not AB though), but I'm not sure which has the same cream texture like that of Innisfree. 

I have tried some from Neutrogena and they are either too thick or smell really weird, and make me breakout too! :( I tested my friend's Elta MD on my hand but it seems to be a bit thick too! I just feel like Innisfree's texture really suits my skin and it's easy to put makeup on. I'm looking for help on this sub because I feel like AB sunscreen will have the same milk-like texture.

380,AsianBeauty,Japanese Makeup/Skincare Mini review!,"So I've been in Japan for about a month now visiting family, I've picked up a lot of makeup, though the majority came from my Seoul trip. Here's a mini review of the products I've picked up in Japan. As a bit of background I have:

Combo (leaning dry) skin

Extremely Fair Complexion

Hormonal Acne and Hyperpigmentation

**Sake High Moisture Skin Lotion Toner From Kikumasamune (4 out of 5 stars)**

This is a great toner. I know some people have broken out from it but I haven't noticed any extra breakouts. It's helped a lot with the flakiness I usually struggle with and it's really inexpensive. The bottle is HUGE and I only paid around 5 USD for it. The only downside is the smell, even if you like sake WOW. It's a lot to put on your face first thing in the morning, but I've gotten used to it. 

**Canmake Cream Blush in the the Shade 02 (5 out of 5 stars)**

One of the brands I was most excited to try in Japan was Canmake. It's a good brand with cute packaging and great prices, and this cream blush is one of my new favorites. It really adds a gorgeous flush to my cheeks, lasts very well, and also gives a subtle sheen/glow. The only real danger is that it's easy to go a little crazy, but I just go over it with a sponge if I think I went a little too ham on my cheeks. I'm going to pick up the other shades before I leave as gifts because it's that good...and that cheap (not that my friends have to know that)

**Canmake Color Mixing Concealer (4 out of 5 stars)**

I bought this because of Pony Syndrome and her glowing reviews of the product, I grabbed the lightest shade and it's a really good concealer, but not for things like under eye bags. I love it for concealing blemishes naturally. The brush it comes with is crap, and I really wouldn't recommend applying it with a finger. It's best with a small, flat tipped brush and blended out with a sponge. I just wish it was a little lighter but I'm a literal ghost so....

**Nivea Skin Milk (5 out of 5 stars)**

I ACTUALLY WANT TO BATHE IN THIS SCENT FOREVER. It smells like orange creamsicles and it feels so so so good on my skin. It's not too heavy but moisturizes very well. I have to buy backups of this before I leave because I don't want to use any other body lotion ever again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading! I might post a review of my products from Korea after I get time to test them all, maybe let me know if you would be interested in that? Ok thanks bye &lt;3",t3_c0tf5u

I made the order on June 2nd, they sent the items the next day and I received them yesterday, in Portugal! No problem with Customs, no taxes. And it only took TEN DAYS to arrive on my hands, it's like I live in Asia. It's so hard to get an asian product in Portugal - either you sell a kidney in Sephora/online european store plus shipping or you buy from an asian store and wait a month for the order. THIS IS HEAVEN! I'm struggling with dry skin+rosacea right now and I didn't have any Benton lotion anymore, so this means the world to me &lt;3

It is PERFECT for my skin. It keeps me oil free pretty much all day and I think it primes my makeup BETTER than my actual makeup primers.

In the same way, it's been hard to do my multi step AB routine. I wanted to share how I simplified my routine to adapt to my lifestyle and maintain the skin I got from doing AB in the first place. Also want to hear your stories of how you streamline your routines! 

I did AB because of dehydrated and combo skin, PIE, PIH, and anti-aging. 


Old routine:
 
AM

- cleanser ( I experimented with a lot) 
- Vit C TO Powder
- Hada Labo skin plumping gel cream - mix with C powder 
- Azaleic acid TO 
- Skin Aqua moisture milk SPF 50 

PM

- cleanser
- Hada Labo premium lotion 
- Cosrx 96 
- TO Caffeine under eye serum 
- Tretinoin 0.25% (x3 week) 
- Cerave Moisturizer Tub 
- Aquaphor 

Time spent - 10-12 mins 

Needless to say, this helped repair my moisture barrier and improved my skin to an extent. 

After a while, this long routine became impossible to do daily. In the last 5 months, I've switched to this. 

AM 

- Hada labo foaming cleanser 
- Skin aqua moisture GEL spf 50 

PM 

- Hada Labo foaming cleanser 
- tret 0.25%
- Stratia liquid gold, if I need it/feel like it 

time spent - 3-5 mins 

My skin is the same as it was 5 months ago. No better, no worse.

I have only tried the unscented version, and granted I have only had the bottle for 24 hours, but it's long enough for me to figure out we won't be best buddies unless one of you kind folk clues me in on a method of use I'm not aware of...

It's just...water??! As in, my skin is exactly the same after using it as it is if I splash water on my face and experience that horrid dry, tightening/pulling sensation. Which I'm surprised about as the pH is good if I understand correctly? Of course I have tried immediately layering over the rest of my routine before it dries (non-AB HG Neutrogena Hydroboost Night Concentrate then Squalene oil) but the Klairs seemingly brings no additional benefit so feel like I may as well not bother. For reference, I recently used up The Face Shop Rice Ceramide toner which I loved, but wanted to swap for something with no fragrance.

In contrast, I have just this a.m tried Hada Labo Premium (what do you mean incorporating new prods slowly?!) and am liking the viscosity a whole lot more so far...

Any tips or tricks for the Klairs?

417,AsianBeauty,"Canmake Mermaid Skin Gel UV now has two versions: 02 White launched as a limited edition on May 1, 2019","When I went to buy the Reddit-famous Canmake sunscreen (**Canmake Mermaid Skin Gel UV**) a couple of weeks ago, there were two versions: **01 Clear** and **02 White**. I just realized that this is a new thing, and it doesn’t look like anyone has posted about it yet (sorry if I just couldn’t find it!), so here’s a heads-up in case anyone is thinking of buying it soon. More info under image.

[From the Canmake website. Left: 02 White. Right: 01 Clear](https://i.redd.it/ibp9hte0ew331.jpg)

The **01 Clear** version, to the right in the image, is the one that was launched in 2015, and is the standard version of the product that everyone has been talking about. I just posted about it yesterday myself, so if you want to hear my thoughts and see the ingredients, look for the fifth sunscreen reviewed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/bz8r9t/japanese_sunscreens_allie_extra_uv_gel_highlight/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).

The **02 White** version (announced [here](https://www.canmake.com/topics/detail/32) in Japanese), to the left in the image, was launched as a limited edition on May 1, 2019, and is meant to have a brightening effect – just in the make-up sense, no actual brightening of the skin itself – as seen in [this photo](https://www.cosme.net/product/product_id/10094530/photo/507662554/num/0) posted by @cosme user Malumaru. I haven’t tried it myself, but I’ll hazard a guess that it would probably just look like a white cast on a lot of skin tones (please do correct me if I’m wrong).

[The English version](https://www.canmake.com/en/item/detail/67) of the official website only shows the Clear version. Both the Clear and White versions are listed on [the Japanese version](https://www.canmake.com/item/detail/67), [@cosme](https://www.cosme.net/product/product_id/10094530/top), and on [RatzillaCosme](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/canmake-mermaid-skin-gel-uv/).

429,AsianBeauty,[REVIEW] Some By Mi — AHA BHA PHA 30 Days Miracle Serum,"Photo: [Packaging and product texture.](https://imgur.com/gallery/w5XVlKz)

Price: 14,500₩

Skin type: Normal/Slightly oily with closed comedones/subclinical acne.

Info: 20, F, NC42 MAC shade.

Rating: No. Just... No.

Review: Honestly, I was pretty hopeful about this. I didn’t buy it as a skincare staple, but my skin has been breaking out due to the pollution lately, and I thought the BHA in this would help. If you see in the photo, the product is in two drops, not because I put two drops on my hand, but because it has so much oil, it just separated from the rest of the liquid.

Now, I’m not sensitive to oils, especially tea tree, which this has, but for some reason, this made my skin mad oily. I looked like a beacon of light, and not in the good way. I usually love skin oils... When they absorb. This just sat on my skin and minded its own business until I took a towel to it.

Don’t even get me started on wearing it under makeup. Thank god I never wore the makeup out of the house, but my foundation definitely thought it was a slip-and-slide. Sis got pores. Sis don’t even have any pores to begin with! 

Its been a long time since my skin reacted to something like this. I’m used to purging, so I thought that’s what this was, but the more I used it, the more I realized it wasn’t me, it was him. He failed me. He turned my face into an oil slick when no one else would.

I’m really disappointed that this is my first review on here, and that it went so astronomically terrible. I wouldn’t wish this product on my worst enemy. If the oil was hydrating, then fine, but it never even absorbed, and when I took it off, my skin was worse than when I put it on. So much for a “miracle serum.”",t3_bzb3hd

I am now sharing some of them in case anyone out there has a similar skin type and/or similar criteria for their sunscreen. Apologies in advance for the long-windedness!

*Made some edits, each indicated by the text EDIT at the beginning, EDIT 2 and EDIT 3 for the Canmake Mermaid Skin Gel UV, EDIT 4 for my skin type, a few additional EDIT 5s before I crosspost, and EDIT 6 about SkinCarisma on Allie Extra UV Gel.*

# THE PREMISE

&amp;#x200B;

* **Skin type:** Most relevantly here, photosensitive, as in allergic to UV rays (and, mildly, to blue light). Dehydrated, mostly dry, ~~sometimes combination/oily,~~ selectively sensitive. I used to have moderate/severe acne a long time ago, and still get a few pimples every now and then.
* **EDIT 4 – Skin type clarification:** Struck out “sometimes combination/oily” above as it’s strictly comparative and might be misleading, even though it feels true. To give you an idea of how dry my skin usually is, I use Weleda Skin Food (non-AB) as a night cream with [Sun White P-1](http://www.sunwhite.net/product/p1.html) (link in Japanese; highly refined petroleum jelly) on top, and everything eventually sinks right in. Adding this because u/stafina_sat’s comment made me think my experiences might be more dry-skin specific than I thought.
* **Usage environment:** I live in western Japan, so it definitely gets really hot and humid during the summer, at which time sweating is a concern. I’m rarely outdoors all day, but it can happen on occasion. I can’t swim, so my sunscreen would only need to be water-resistant enough for my sweat, and whether the UV filters are reef safe or not is not a concern.
* **Specific criteria:** Definitely **SPF 50+ PA++++**, even if I’m indoors. I tend to avoid sunscreens advertised as being for sensitive skin (even though I do have relatively sensitive skin), for fear that they might not provide enough protection. Sunscreen milks would probably be better suited for my skin type, but I’ve tried a few and decided I hate them, so I always buy **gels** and **essences**. I also go through my sunscreen pretty quickly, so I only buy what I can get from the drugstores in my neighborhood, for both availability and cost.
* **Other things to note:** I put on *a lot* of sunscreen. Definitely at least the recommended 1/4-teaspoon amount. So when I say something leaves a white cast or is greasy, it might not be the case in “normal” use. On the other hand, I’m on the pale side, so white casts are less detectable on me than those with darker skin. Also, I’m not a chemist or otherwise qualified beyond being bilingual, so I apologize for any mistranslations in the lists of ingredients. And please keep in mind that the “advertised as” part isn’t very thorough.
* **EDIT – Make-up notes:** I forgot to mention that I don’t wear foundation, so I don’t know how any of these wear under full make-up. Sunscreen is a much bigger priority for me than foundation, so if you wear make-up, my reviews might not necessarily be useful for you. I do wear BB cream when I go out ([La Roche-Posay Uvidea XL Protection BB in 01: Light](https://www.laroche-posay.jp/?p_id=L00195); link in Japanese), but I often don’t bother reapplying that along with my sunscreen. If I want to bring down the shininess, I use [the skincare powder from Ettusais](https://www.ettusais.co.jp/items/95859/) (link in Japanese); I definitely use the powder if I want to use powder blush with any of these sunscreens, but not if I’m using cream blush.
* **TL;DR ratings:** HG = holy grail, WRP = will repurchase, WNRP = will not repurchase.

1. Kanebo **Allie Extra UV Gel** 2018 formula (SPF 50+ PA++++): Long-reigning **HG** but still looking

* **Links:** [Official website](https://www.kanebo-cosmetics.co.jp/products/2027879) (link in Japanese), [RatzillaCosme](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-extra-uv-gel-spf50/)
* **UV filters:** Zinc oxide, octinoxate, Uvinul T 150, Tinosorb S
* **Advertised as:** Friction-proof, water resistant, ADVAN UV barrier technology, moisturizing, easy to wash off, fragrance-free, paraben-free, can wear under make-up, for use on face and body

Allie Extra UV Gel and its predecessors have been a long-time favorite. I’ve been using it for years, so I know it will protect me (with reapplication as necessary of course), and I know it won’t specifically be the cause for any breakouts. In Japan, the general consensus seems to be that you use either Allie or Anessa if you really don’t want to burn/tan, and I didn’t like the Anessa sunscreens I tried in the past (then again, they were all milks). It does contain alcohol and smells like it too, but I like that it doesn‘t have any fragrances to cover it, like almost all of the sunscreens listed here. I also don’t think it’s drying in spite of the alcohol, especially if you’ve moisturized before using it. If I need to be sure I’m protected, if I’m having skin problems, or if I’m feeling wary of whatever new sunscreen I’m trying out for any reason, I always go back to this one.

The only reason why I’m still trying other sunscreens is because it does leave a white cast upon application – if you put on as much as I do, at least (I’ve seen reviews that say it doesn’t have a white cast). It does go away after a bit, so it’s not a problem when I’m getting ready in the morning or when I’m reapplying in a restroom, but it does bother me a little when I’m reapplying anywhere else.

Also, this used to get white stuff all over my belongings, but the new formula should be an improvement on this front. I say “should be” because this can‘t be fully tested until it‘s full-blown summer and my arms and legs are constantly exposed *and* sweaty.

It was recommended by Dr. Dray in [a recent Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bx2JS8OnyZE/) (and [a slightly less favorable but more in-depth review from 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6u-4OoShik) that I just found), and performed very well in [what can be described as the Japanese version of that one experiment in China that everyone was talking about recently](https://kakakumag.com/houseware/?id=11834) (link in Japanese; January 2019). In fact, a different version of it ([Allie Extra UV Facial Gel](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-extra-uv-facial-gel-spf50/)) also performed very well in [the experiment in China](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/bt8q1t/discussion_sunscreen_experiment_1pm_4pm_exposure/) too (I found the predecessor of the Extra UV Facial Gel to be more drying than the predecessor of the Extra UV Gel; haven’t tried the current version). I remember these things because it’s the sunscreen I always go back to, and feel strangely vindicated every time someone else likes it too.

I see that it’s often considered expensive, but it actually costs about the same or even less than Bioré UV Athlizm Skin Protect Essence, which people seem less averse to buying (if we take Amazon Japan as an example, ¥2061 JPY for 90 g of Allie Extra UV Gel = ¥22.9 JPY per gram, and ¥1618 JPY for 70 g of the Athlizm essence = ¥23.114285714 JPY per gram).

* **EDIT 6:** To quote from [my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/c43rxx/science_skincarebeauty_apps_and_online_resources/):

&gt;I really like the idea of SkinCarisma. \[…\] until I tried looking up one of my favorite products, [Allie Extra UV Gel](https://www.skincarisma.com/products/allie/extra-uv-gel-spf50-pa), and found a really obvious mistake: I love this sunscreen and all, but it most definitely is NOT alcohol-free. The list of ingredients says Ethanol, not Ethanolamine. SkinCarisma also skips over Triethylhexanoin, and lists Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer instead of Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, EDTA instead of Disodium EDTA, and Hyaluronic Acid instead of Sodium Hyaluronate (or maybe some of these are actually interchangeable – I’m not qualified to say). Also, BHT has a score of 4, not 6, [according to the EWG’s own database](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/700741/BHT/), but maybe that was updated after the data was entered on SkinCarisma or something.  
&gt;  
&gt;At first I thought maybe the list is for an older formulation, but I’m pretty sure it’s contained alcohol for as long as I can remember, based on how it smells. Maybe this is a fluke and they just had some problems with this particular product, but I would be sure to compare the list with the official list of ingredients, just in case.

**^(Ingredients:)** ^(Water, zinc oxide, ethanol, octinoxate, triethylhexanoin, isononyl isononanoate, butylene glycol, glycerin, dimethicone, Uvinul T 150, Tinosorb S, sodium acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, triethoxycaprylylsilane, isohexadecane, polysorbate-80, xanthan gum, disodium EDTA, BHT, sodium hyaluronate, hydrolyzed collagen)

&amp;#x200B;

2. Kanebo **Allie Extra UV Highlight Gel** 2018 formula (SPF 50+ PA++++): **WNRP**, but not because of the product itself

* **Links:** [Official website](https://www.kanebo-cosmetics.co.jp/products/2038515) (link in Japanese), [RatzillaCosme](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-extra-uv-highlight-gel-spf50/)
* **UV filters:** Zinc oxide, octinoxate, Tinosorb S, Uvinul T 150, titanium dioxide
* **Advertised as:** Friction-proof, water resistant, ADVAN UV barrier technology, moisturizing, fragrance-free, paraben-free, can wear under make-up, for face and body

For the most part, this feels similar to the Extra UV Gel. The difference is that this one is tinted green, like the new limited edition Skin Aqua that just came out recently. The ingredients are basically the same as the Extra UV Gel too, except this one also includes titanium dioxide (probably as a colorant, though I included it among the UV filters), mica, silica, and CI 42090, or Blue 1 in Japan, and a couple of ingredients are in different positions on the list. Obviously I don’t hate it, but I ignored an important lesson I learned from the lavender Skin Aqua I bought last year (review below) – if the sunscreen is tinted, I’m not going to put on as much of it, and hence I won’t get as much protection as I would from one that isn’t. This is entirely my own fault and not the product’s. In fact, this seems to be a pretty popular product here in Japan, so I may be in the minority. Personally I think it would be better for me to stick with normal sunscreen and use a different color correcting product over it.

3. Kao **Bioré UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence** version q/2019 formula (SPF 50+ PA++++): **WNRP**

* **Links:** [Official website](https://www.kao.com/jp/bioresarasarauv/bsu_aquarich_essence_00.html) (link in Japanese); [RatzillaCosme](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/biore-uv-aqua-rich-watery-essence-2019/)
* **UV filters:** Octinoxate, Uvinul T 150, Uvinul A Plus, Tinosorb S
* **Advertised as:** Micro Defense technology, moisturizing, no white cast, water resistant, easy to wash off, can wear under make-up, white muguet fragrance, colorant-free, non-comedogenic, hypoallergenic

I tried this a long time ago, possibly the 2015 version if not earlier, and my face turned red in that about-to-get-a-sun-rash way that I’m all too familiar with. This generally doesn’t happen with SPF 50+ PA++++ sunscreens, and my trust in that line plummeted. I heard about the new formula’s “Micro Defense technology,” which made it seem like it could be worth giving it another try, because I do recall liking how refreshingly hydrating it felt. Now, either the formula has changed completely or I remembered wrong, because this is probably the greasiest sunscreen I own. (I have to note that it’s possible that I just feel that way because I was expecting more of it, but it’s definitely at least among the greasier ones.) One layer was okay, but upon reapplication I felt so greasy that I ended up washing it off and putting something else on. Maybe I need to apply less, but then I’d be concerned about its effectiveness. There’s also the matter that I would still feel nervous about wearing it outside, regardless of how much of it I apply. So I don’t trust it for outdoor use, and it’s not even comfortable enough to warrant buying it separately for indoor use. The fragrance is also quite strong. I’ll finish the current tube, but I’m not sure I would ever be giving this a third chance.

* **EDIT:** I should probably note that I only started using this *very* recently and may change my opinion at any time.
* **EDIT 5:** I’m not 100% sure – I don’t feel compelled to try putting it on my face again just to check – but I think this makes me break out. Nothing extreme, just four pimples, but I usually only get maybe one at a time so four seemed plenty break-out-like. It *could* possibly be the Bioré UV Athlizm Skin Protect Essence (reviewed below) or maybe something else entirely.

**^(Ingredients:)** ^(Water, ethanol, octinoxate, Uvinul T 150, isopropyl myristate, lauryl methacrylate/sodium methacrylate crosspolymer, Uvinul A Plus, hydrogenated polyisobutene, Tinosorb S, dextrin palmitate, butylene glycol, xylitol, acrylates/C10–30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, dimethicone, C12–15 alkyl benzoate, glycerin, glyceryl stearate, propanediol, glyceryl behenate, vinyl dimethicone/methicone silsesquioxane crosspolymer, cetyl alcohol, agar, sorbitan distearate, isoceteth-20, polyvinyl alcohol, dimethicone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer, stearoyl glutamic acid, arginine, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, royal jelly extract, sodium hyaluronate, phenoxyethanol, disodium EDTA, BHT, fragrance)

4. Kao **Bioré UV Athlizm Skin Protect Essence** (SPF 50+ PA++++): **WRP**

* **Links:** [Official website](https://www.kao.com/jp/bioresarasarauv/bsu_athlizm_essence_00.html) (link in Japanese), [RatzillaCosme](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/biore-uv-athlizm-skin-protect-essence/)
* **UV filters:** Octinoxate, Uvinul T 150, Uvinul A Plus, Tinosorb S
* **Advertised as:** Flagship sunscreen for Bioré, Tough Boost technology, moisturizing, water resistant, easy to wash off, can wear under make-up, white floral fragrance, non-comedogenic, tested at 40℃/75% humidity

This one is currently a contender for outdoor use. I don’t like that it has a strong fragrance and that it feels very much like a film on top of my skin, but the latter also makes me feel protected, so this might be a good option for when I need heavy-duty protection. I’m sure the milk would be more waterproof etc., but again, I hate milks. It also doesn’t apply with a white cast, so it’s currently becoming my top choice for reapplication when I’m out and about, but I also wash it off as soon as I get home, especially if I reapplied more than once. I wish they had a larger size than 70 g, because one day I applied/reapplied four times on my face, neck, and arms, and felt like I’d already used up most of the tube.

* **EDIT 5:** The Bioré UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence (reviewed above) feels like the more likely culprit, but this may possibly have made me break out. Unlike the Aqua Rich, I will eventually be putting this on my face again, so I’ll edit the post again if it turns out to be this one.

**^(Ingredients:)** ^(Water, ethanol, octinoxate, Uvinul T 150, isopropyl myristate, lauryl methacrylate/sodium methacrylate crosspolymer, Uvinul A Plus, hydrogenated polyisobutene, sodium acrylates copolymer, Tinosorb S, dextrin palmitate, butylene glycol, acrylates/C10–30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, C12–15 alkyl benzoate, glycerin, propanediol, potassium hydroxide, glyceryl behenate, hydroxyethyl cellulose, vinyl dimethicone/methicone silsesquioxane crosspolymer, pullulan, cetyl alcohol, sorbitan distearate, stearoyl glutamic acid, arginine, disodium EDTA, BHT, royal jelly extract, sodium hyaluronate, phenoxyethanol, fragrance)

5. Ida Laboratories **Canmake Mermaid Skin Gel UV: 01 Clear** (SPF 50+ PA++++): **WRP**, maybe even **HG** for indoor use

* **Links:** [Official website](https://www.canmake.com/en/item/detail/67), [RatzillaCosme](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/canmake-mermaid-skin-gel-uv/)
* **UV filters:** Octinoxate, Uvinul A Plus, zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, Tinosorb S
* **Advertised as:** Washes off easily, for all seasons, moisturizing, for face and body, can use right after washing face as skincare/moisturizing primer/SPF primer

To be honest, I didn’t expect to like this, but Canmake and its ~~sister~~ (probably more like) cousin brand Cezanne do consistently surprise me with their make-up, and it’s so highly recommended here and so cheap that I decided to buy a tube. It’s now my favorite for indoor use. It contains neither alcohol nor fragrances, and really just feels like a moisturizer or primer as they say, although I definitely use my regular moisturizing products too. No white cast, of course. It kind of smells slightly funny… Almost like butterscotch?? I have no idea how to describe it. Anyway, it’s faint enough to ignore. With titanium dioxide listed fairly early on in the ingredients, I’m wondering whether it might also be at least slightly protective against blue light as well (don’t quote me on that). It’s so comfortable that I’m afraid to wear it outside, but it’s definitely sufficient when I’m staying home. It’s almost as cheap as Bioré UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence per gram. This one *definitely* needs to come in a bigger tube, but then again, they would probably have to modify their drugstore displays significantly to fit, say, a 90 g tube. But really, hats off to Ida Laboratories. Great products for truly affordable prices.

* **EDIT:** I should probably note that I only started using this *very* recently and may change my opinion at any time.
* **EDIT 2:** Yes, of course I follow u/amyvancheese’s posts on r/SkincareAddiction quite closely. [Here is her experiment with Canmake Mermaid Skin Gel UV](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/buwnbf/sun_care_review_a_day_of_wearing_canmake_mermaid/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) (I’m assuming the clear version, since I don’t think she specified). In spite of being ridiculously cosmetically elegant, it seems to stay put for almost three hours. But until I finally get my own Sunscreenr and can test for my own climate/skin type/etc. (or accidentally do a real-life experiment wearing it outside), I’m still going to think of it as an indoor sunscreen. As u/kaylamariko says in the comments below, it’s actually so good that it seems too good to be true. It doesn’t claim to be water resistant though, so it definitely won’t be enough for the humid, sweaty summers here.
* **EDIT 3:** I just learned that the 02 White version is a new development (officially released on May 1, 2019), so I should probably add a heads-up about this. The white one is meant to have a brightening effect (see for example [this photo](https://www.cosme.net/product/product_id/10094530/photo/507662554/num/0) posted on @cosme), but I imagine it would just look like a white cast on a lot of skin tones, so be careful to make sure you have the version you want when you buy this.
* **EDIT 5:** I posted more about the White version [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/bzp5j1/canmake_mermaid_skin_gel_uv_now_has_two_versions/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). Also, I finished my first tube in a little over two weeks, and that includes days where I was wearing something else. *And* I only wear it on my face and the front of my neck, with one of the WNRPs on my arms and the back of my neck. (Again, I probably put on a lot more than most people do, so it would most likely last longer for most.) Like I said, it’s also one of my cheapest sunscreens per gram so having to buy it so often isn’t a problem financially, but it definitely feels like way too much wasted plastic. It seems like none of their cream/gel products are available in tubes any bigger than this (70 g), so this might be asking for a lot, but I really wish it was available in a larger size.

**^(Ingredients:)** ^(Water, octinoxate, butylene glycol, Uvinul A Plus, zinc oxide, methylheptyl laurate, titanium dioxide, dimethicone, Tinosorb S, polymethylsilsesquioxane, cyclopentasiloxane, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, diisostearyl malate, aluminum hydroxide, PEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil, stearic acid, phenoxyethanol, polyglyceryl-3 polydimethylsiloxyethyl dimethicone, polyhydroxystearic acid, jojoba esters, xanthan gum, arginine, sodium hyaluronate, alpha-glucan, phytic acid, saxifraga stolonifera extract, glucosylceramide, prunus yedoensis leaf extract, coix lacryma-jobi ma-yuen seed extract, white mulberry root extract, evening primrose seed extract, silver oxide, meadowsweet flower extract, bilberry leaf extract, artichoke leaf extract)

&amp;#x200B;

6. **Etvos Mineral UV Powder** (IV) 2019 formula (SPF 50 PA++++): **WRP** for now, but only because I don’t know of anything better

* **Links:** [Official website](https://etvos.com/shop/g/gAE10255-000/) (link in Japanese)
* **UV filters:** Zinc oxide, titanium dioxide
* **Advertised as:** Blocks UV rays, blue light, and infrared light; moisturizing; free of petroleum-based surfactants, mineral oil, silicone, tar colorants, artificial fragrances, preservatives, and chemical UV filters

Until recently, I was working extremely long hours directly in front of a very bright 27-inch iMac, which is probably the most blue light anyone would ever get. At one point I finally figured out why I was getting a photosensitive reaction on my face in the middle of the night. Blue light damage is real, according to my face. It really takes a lot of it before anything happens, though, so I only really worry about it if I’m going to spend hours in front of a computer. It felt marginally better when I put my usual Allie Extra UV Gel on out of desperation, which I now realize makes perfect sense because it lists zinc oxide as its second ingredient.

Later on, I started seeing articles about skin damage from blue light, and looked into products that address this concern. There is a whole line of skincare products called [And Mirai](https://www.fancl.jp/andmirai/index.html) from Fancl (link in Japanese), but I wanted something that would be easier to add to the products I already use. So then I found this powder from Etvos. I just ran a search and am surprised to find that Etvos has never been mentioned here. Yes, they’re on the pricey side – maybe on the upper side of mid-range, with both department store counters and displays at Loft and the like – and this is one of the few departures from my drugstore rule. The brand puts a lot of emphasis on “safe” ingredients, if you can’t tell already from the advertisement claims above. I also have a couple of make-up products of theirs that I am liking very much. The powder is apparently reformulated every year, so this is strictly about the current version.

The powder itself is translucent on me, but it *is* tinted, so I’m not sure how it would look on anyone with ivory-fair or darker skin than mine. I pulled one all-nighter in front of a less bright, smaller monitor and remained unscathed, but that isn’t really a fair comparison so I can’t swear on its effectiveness just yet. It does give me peace of mind, though. I would also use this for reapplication if I’m wearing make-up and staying indoors, although that situation hasn’t arisen yet. One complaint that I have is that the case is cute but not very functional. It seems like a lot of people have a problem with this, actually – it’s one of those fully plastic cases with holes in the inner lid for the powder to come through. If I use the puff straight from the case, I end up with dots of powder on my face, so I’ve been using my usual non-SPF powder first, and then layering this over it. It’s kind of a pain, so I’ve only been using it when I’m sitting in front of my computer for an extended amount of time. Much like their skincare line, the powder includes an impressive array of ceramides, but I wouldn’t get too excited considering it is after all a powder. Overall, it’s not *bad*, but I would definitely want to try other similar products if I find any.

**^(Ingredients:)** ^(Mica, silica, zinc oxide, kaolin, ceramide EOP, ceramide NG, ceramide NP, ceramide AG, ceramide AP, sodium hyaluronate, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, polyquaternium-61, tremella fuciformis polysaccharide, baikal scullcap root extract, chamomile flower extract, saxifraga stolonifera extract, argan kernel oil, sunflower oil, dipotassium glycyrrhizate, trehalose, squalane, butylene glycol, water, phytosterols , hydrogenated lecithin, disodium stearoyl glutamate, calcium carbonate, barium sulfate, titanium dioxide, iron oxide, aluminum hydroxide, polyglyceryl-2 triisostearate)

7. Napla **Mieufa Fragrance UV Spray: Magnolia** (SPF 50+ PA++++): **WRP**

* **Links:** [Official website](https://www.napla.co.jp/products/mieufa/) (link in Japanese; page for the entire Mieufa line)
* **UV filters:** Octinoxate, zinc oxide, Parsol SLX, Uvinul A Plus, Tinosorb S, titanium dioxide
* **Advertised as:** Protects hair and skin from UV rays; Magnolia version smells like orange, jasmine, and magnolias, and contains orange oil to combat unwanted odors

I wrote a comment about the spray [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/bxwu2c/anyone_use_uv_protection_products_for_hair_and/eqbjcva), copied-and-pasted for your convenience:

&gt;The most hair-specific one I know of is Mieufa Fragrance UV Spray. You can use it on your face and body too – the usual rules for sunscreen sprays apply, and you aren’t supposed to spray this directly on your face – but it’s sold in hair salons and includes hair conditioning ingredients. It’s made by Napla, whose hair oil under the N. brand (which I also have and like) is probably more famous at the moment. I’ll try to go into detail since their English website is [abysmal](http://www.napla.co.jp/english/concept/mieufa/) and [the information is outdated (and misspelled)](http://www.napla.co.jp/english/spec/mieufa/), and it looks like it’s not on RatzillaCosme either. I promise they seem like a good brand in Japanese!  
&gt;  
&gt;The fragrances currently available are Magnolia, Oriental Jasmine, Sea Salt, Tender Lily, and Cherie Savon. Each version features a different plant-based oil or extract for a specific hair conditioning function (possibly except for Cherie Savon, which doesn’t have an oil/extract in its blurb). While it’s called a fragrance spray, there’s also a fragrance-free version, Clear, but I haven’t tried it yet. It does contain grape seed oil and plant extracts, and might not be ultra-sensitive-skin friendly (but they don’t claim it is, either). Again, while these sprays can also be used on your skin, they’re marketed more as hair products. It’s an aerosol spray and the canister is pretty small, but I figure that makes it easier to carry around for reapplication.  
&gt;  
&gt;I have the Magnolia version and personally enjoy the fragrance, but it could stand to be a little more subtle. Then again, I’m always paranoid about smelling too strong. According to [this page](https://www.tsfamiliar.com/SHOP/MF001.html) (link in Japanese), the top notes are jasmine, magnolia, and rose; the middle notes are orange and peach; and the base notes are musk, amber, and white cedar. I’m not sure I get all that, but I’ve always been bad at identifying fragrance notes. I’m on my second or third bottle, but obviously I find myself avoiding it if I want to wear perfume or anything else with a significant fragrance. This means I use it *much* less often than I should, so I’m thinking about getting the Clear version too. The line-up has changed significantly since when I started buying Magnolia, so I’m also curious about the newer variations.  
&gt;  
&gt;Overall, I would recommend this if you aren’t allergic to plant extracts and oils, and if you like the fragrance. I have to note that I use non-spray sunscreen on my face and body, so I can’t fully speak for its use on skin. For what it’s worth, I haven’t had any bad reactions on my scalp or ears.  
&gt;  
&gt;Apart from being sold at hair salons, I saw them at a Plaza store just the other day, and they should be available at Loft and Tokyu Hands too. In case it isn’t obvious already, I live in Japan so unfortunately I don’t really know about international availability. I do see a couple of Rakuten Global listings for under ¥900 JPY, and I can confirm that they do show up for the same price or even cheaper on the domestic Rakuten Ichiba too.

**^(Ingredients:)** ^(Liquefied petroleum gas, water, octinoxate, cyclopentasiloxane, methylpentanediol dineopentanoate, zinc oxide, fragrance, orange oil, camellia sinensis tar, dog rose fruit extract, rosemary leaf extract, lavender flower extract, thyme flower/leaf extract, sage leaf extract, yarrow extract, butylene glycol, Parsol SLX, dimethicone, butyl acrylate/glycol dimethacrylate crosspolymer, Uvinul A Plus, Tinosorb S, lauryl PEG-9 polydimethylsiloxyethyl dimethicone, acrylates/dimethicone copolymer, PEG-9 polydimethylsiloxyethyl dimethicone, polyhydroxystearic acid, talc, phenoxyethanol, methyl methacrylate/glycol dimethacrylate crosspolymer, hydrogen dimethicone, titanium dioxide, silica, stearyl glycyrrhetinate, aluminum hydroxide, dimethicone/methicone copolymer, BHT, ethanol, tocopherol)

8. Kao **Nivea Sun Protect Water Gel Extra Cool** (SPF 50+ PA+++): **WNRP**

* **Links:** [@cosme](https://www.cosme.net/product/product_id/10110295/top) (link in Japanese), [RatzillaCosme](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/nivea-sun-protect-water-gel-50-extra-cool/)
* **UV filters:** Octinoxate, Uvinul T 150, Uvinul A Plus

This one was limited-edition and is no longer in production, so I’ll keep it brief. It’s a spray that turns into a gel on your skin, which is kind of fun and gimmicky. The cooling sensation definitely doesn’t last. Kind of a ”why did I buy this” impulse purchase. It’s not even PA++++.

**^(Ingredients:)** ^(Dimethyl ether, ethanol, octinoxate, dimethicone, trisiloxane, Uvinul T 150, Uvinul A Plus, jojoba oil, hydroxypropyl cellulose, menthol, menthyl lactate)

&amp;#x200B;

9. BCL Company **Saborino Ohayo Sun Cut UV Spray Cool** (SPF 50+ PA++++): **WNRP**

* **Links:** [Official website](https://www.bcl-brand.jp/product/product-26539/) (link in Japanese), [RatzillaCosme](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/saborino-morning-sun-cut-uv-spray-spf50/)
* **UV filters:** Octinoxate, Uvinul A Plus
* **Advertised as:** Cooling effect; lavender coloring; for use on face, hair, and body; spray right after washing face to cover skincare, SPF, and make-up all at once; water resistant; moisturizing; fruity herb fragrance; easy to wash off

I like the idea of Saborino’s products, which all multitask in some way and are marketed toward the busy and/or lazy. I like the idea, but I find it rarely works out as promised. Even before purchasing this, I knew there’s no way I would just spray this on without my usual moisturizers. For better or for worse, the lavender color isn’t noticeable, even on my jet black hair. I’m not a huge fan of the fragrance; I don’t hate it, but I would rather smell like the Mieufa spray. Overall, a run-of-the-mill sunscreen spray. Again, I would rather use the Mieufa, which even has a more impressive array of UV filters.

**^(Ingredients:)** ^(Ethanol, dimethyl ether, octinoxate, cyclopentasiloxane, cyclohexasiloxane, aloe vera leaf extract, peppermint leaf extract, tea tree leaf oil, honey, sodium hyaluronate, sunflower oil, soluble collagen, butylene glycol, talc, hydroxypropyl cellulose, menthol, water, Uvinul A Plus, fragrance, CI 60725)

&amp;#x200B;

10. Rohto **Skin Aqua Tone Up UV Essence** 2018 formula (SPF 50+ PA++++): **WNRP**

* **Links:** [Official website](https://jp.rohto.com/skin-aqua/tone-up-essence/) (link in Japanese; 2019 formula), [RatzillaCosme](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/skin-aqua-tone-uv-essence/)
* **UV filters:** Octinoxate, titanium dioxide, Uvinul A Plus, Tinosorb S
* **Advertised as:** Lavender tint for color correction; other skin brightning ingredients; savon fragrance; water resistant; can wear under make-up; easy to wash off; for face and body

Initially, I really liked this and bought several tubes. But as I mentioned with the Allie Extra UV Highlight Gel, I eventually came to the conclusion that as a photosensitive person, I probably shouldn’t be using tinted sunscreens. The coloring leads me to use in moderation, which leaves me a bit concerned about whether I’m getting its full effectiveness as a sunscreen. I also started to feel like it’s slightly drying – not enough to be the primary reason why I won’t be buying this any more, but something to note. If I were to buy a tinted sunscreen again, I would go for the Allie Extra UV Highlight Gel. Also, the lavender color correction effect is fine on me, a relatively pale Asian, but I suspect it would just look like a white cast on a lot of skin tones.

That said, I’m curious whether the 2019 formula might be more hydrating, and whether there are any improvements that might benefit me. But again, I think it’s probably not a great idea for me to buy tinted sunscreens.

**^(Ingredients:)** ^(Water, ethanol, octinoxate, butylene glycol, diphenylsiloxy phenyl trimethicone, titanium dioxide, Uvinul A Plus, sodium hyaluronate, ascorbyl-2-phosphate magnesium, passion fruit extract, hydrolyzed prunus domestica, rosa roxburghii fruit extract, bis-PEG-18 methyl ether dimethyl silane, methyl methacrylate crosspolymer, glycol dimethacrylate crosspolymer, Tinosorb S, acrylates copolymer, polysorbate-60, acrylates/C10–30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, triethanolamine, ammonium acryloyldimethyl taurate/VP copolymer, silica, PEG-12 dimethicone, polystyrene, polyvinyl alcohol, disodium EDTA, xanthan gum, alumina, BHT, polyglyceryl-2 triisostearate, synthetic fluorphlogopite, tin oxide, CI 73360, CI 42090, fragrance)

&amp;#x200B;

11. Rohto **Skin Aqua Water Magic UV Oil Spray** (SPF 50+ PA++++): **WNRP**, but not because of the product itself

* **Links:** [Official website](https://jp.rohto.com/skin-aqua/water-magic/) (link in Japanese), [RatzillaCosme](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/skin-aqua-water-magic-uv-spf50/)
* **UV filters:** Octinoxate, Uvinul A Plus, Uvinul T 150, Tinosorb S
* **Advertised as:** Water Fit technology, can use on wet skin, for face and body, no white cast, easy to wash off, citrus fragrance, hypoallergenic

The emphasis here is on waterproofing. It does call itself an oil spray, so it’s not too surprising that it feels rather greasy/sticky. I don’t do water sports, so it’s kind of a bit much for me. I bought it last year, or maybe even the year before, and am still stuck with it. I don’t think it’s necessarily bad, just not what I need; I imagine the wet skin part would be very useful in certain situations.

**^(Ingredients:)** ^(Liquefied petroleum gas, ethanol, triethylhexyl trimellitate, caprylic/capric triglyceride, diphenylsiloxy phenyl trimethicone, diethylhexyl succinate, octinoxate, dipropylene glycol, dextrin palmitate/ethylhexanoate, isononyl isononanoate, Uvinul A Plus, polymethylsilsesquioxane, Uvinul T 150, Tinosorb S, RonaCare AP, carnosine, water, fragrance)

&amp;#x200B;

12. Kosé **Sports Beauty Sun Protect Gel** (SPF 50+ PA++++): Probably **WNRP**

* **Links:** [Official website](https://www.kose.co.jp/sportsbeauty/products.html) (link in Japanese; page for entire Sports Beauty line), [RatzillaCosme](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/sports-beauty-sun-protect-gel/)
* **UV filters:** Octinoxate, zinc oxide, Parsol SLX, Uvinul A Plus, Tinosorb S
* **Advertised as:** Water resistant, tested by athletes, friction-proof, easy to wash off, moisturizing, for face and body, hypoallergenic, uses less oils to make it feel more hydrating

This really isn’t a bad sunscreen at all, and it’s still a contender alongside the Athlizm essence for my reapply-on-the-go sunscreen. No white cast, and their efforts to make it hydrating seems to have paid off fairly well. The only thing that puts me off is that the fragrance is really strong. Athlizm’s fragrance is strong too, but I think Sports Beauty’s is stronger by just a hair. I do like that it feels less film-y than Athlizm, although that’s also part of Athlizm’s appeal. It all comes down to whether I can learn to live with the fragrance – but then I think I’d rather live with Allie’s initial white cast, which probably goes away before this fragrance does.

* **EDIT 5:** I feel like I might have made it sound more hydrating than it is. I wouldn’t say it’s any more hydrating than the other sunscreens, so don’t pick it for that.

**^(Ingredients:)** ^(Water, octinoxate, ethanol, zinc oxide, dimethicone, Parsol SLX, Uvinul A Plus, mica, propylene glycol dicaprate, Tinosorb S, dipropylene glycol, tocopherol, jojoba leaf extract, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, soluble collagen, butylene glycol, BHT, PEG-10 hydrogenated castor oil, PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil, sodium acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, acrylic acid/C10–30 alkyl acrylate copolymer, dimethicone/polyglycerin-3 crosspolymer, vinyl dimethicone/lauryl dimethicone crosspolymer, isohexadecane, sorbitan oleate, xanthan gum, citric acid, squalane, stearoyl inulin, sorbitan sesquioleate, triethylhexanoin, triethoxycaprylylsilane, nylon-12, polyquaternium-7, polysorbate-80, polyhydroxystearic acid, phenoxyethanol, sodium benzoate, fragrance)

I've never heard of this product before, and I don't find it when searching for it here or on r/SkincareAddiction. Most of the results on Google are blog posts from 2017 (many of them are the same blog post as well), and it's not listed on YesStyle.

Has anyone of you used this product? Or even heard of it? I'm adding a picture recklessly stolen from Google for reference. :)

438,AsianBeauty,"Did China banned animal testing? (Spoiler alert: NO, THEY DIDN'T)"," You may have seen the news that [China has recently announced](https://globalcosmeticsnews.com/one-step-closer-to-cruelty-free-chinas-national-medical-association-ends-post-market-animal-testing-for-cosmetics/)  they would stop conducting animal tests on post-market imported and  domestically produced cosmetic products, and you may be asking ""what are  *""post-market""* products?"". Well, the  government of China is allowed to take post-market products (products  that are already on the market in China) out of the shelves to test them  on animals at any time (btw, brands are aware of it when accepting to  sell their products on the country). What China did was:

1. End the random animal tests on post-market products, EXCEPT for special cases (ex: customers complains, etc.)
2. Include two new animal-free tests on their pre-market routine (pre-market = before being put on the market).

That being said, pre-market animal tests ARE STILL REQUIRED before putting a product for sale on China.

China is trying TO REDUCE animal testing on the country, but they didn't banned the practice.

So,  i'm always looking for good cruelty-free asian products, but you may  have noticed that is quite tricky to find out, especially since the  asian brands don't have cruelty-free certificates stamped on their  packaging (the bunny logo), so i always refer to the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qIO8FGyDiByQ-kB_Lfv-Wa6tugU4DYolBzi8GBPMpWY/edit#gid=0) shared here on Reddit, [Skipping Bun Bun](https://www.facebook.com/SkippingBunBun/posts/587538444730341/) on Facebook, and sometimes the [Ratzilla cruelty-free list](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/tips/japanese-cosmetic-companies-not-tested-on-animals/).

As  you can see, the majority of asian beauty companies doesn't test on  animals themselves, BUT allow other countries to test their products on  animals if required by law (a.k.a China). So, the main question should  be ***""how to know if a brand it is sold in China?"".*** Well, i don't know... Maybe contacting the brand an asking them? Do you guys have a way to know it?

If you could pick between  $100 on skincare or $300-400 on Botox every 3-4 months which one would you pick? 

If prevention is the best strategy should we be throwing all our money into while our skin is in better shape? It seems so costly and I haven’t even stepped into the word of fancy lasers or chemical peels yet.

478,AsianBeauty,[Review]Mini Reviews of 30 Sheet Masks,"*I'm not great at formatting. I hope this looks ok.*


I have a slight obsession with sheet masks and keep notes and grades for every one I use. I figured I'd share my mini-reviews in case anyone is looking for info on any of these.


**My skin type:**  maturing (I'll be 40 this year), oily/dehydrated and acne prone. Tends toward dullness, and I'm constantly battling redness from irritation caused by several autoimmune conditions and old acne, and flushing caused by a couple of my prescription medications. Lately I try to focus on masks that are just for hydration and soothing irritation, but I have used other types in the past with mixed results. I also recently dealt with a very mild, but persistent case of suspected fungal acne that I've gotten control of through the use of Nizoral and sulfur soap for 3 months, while eliminating all other skincare. Now that it's gone, I'm not having any trouble keeping it away even with some non-FA safe products, as long as I use Nizoral and sulfur soap once/week, but I'm always ready and willing to drop everything again if needed if there's a rebound of it.

I've purchased these from a variety of sources, including Jolse, RoseRose, Facetory, Masksheets, Beauteque, SweetCorea, and others.

I give each a grade of A-F the day after I use it (I wait to make sure there's no irritation that doesn't show up for several hours), and just keep very basic notes on different aspects of them. With the variety of masks out there, I'll only repurchase A's, with the exception of B's that are very very cheap and still do an adequate job.


I hope this is helpful, and thanks for reading!


- **Real Barrier Aqua Soothing Ampoule Mask: A++.** This is my HG of all time. Super-high quality sheet that fits really well without a lot of cutting and shaping needed. Has soooo much essence and I can always make a 2nd mask with a compressed sheet from the leftover. I've purchased boxes of this more than once and will continue to. Leaves my skin so soothed and hydrated. I can leave this thing on for 30 minutes and still feel like it could go longer. These have been difficult to find to ship to the U.S. but Jolse has started carrying them, which makes me super-happy!

- **Blossom Jeju Red Camellia Soombi 2 Step Deep Nourishing: A+.** This would be an HG if it weren't so dang expensive. This experience was luxury in a small package. Left my skin glowy and plump and the effects lasted a couple of days at least. I'm always watching for sales on these, but rarely find them. I would definitely purchase this one to use before an event.

- **Goodall Mild Sheet Mask - Citron: A.** Fantastic cheap mask. Sheet was good quality, fit well without much adjustment, and contained lots of essence. Fantastic for redness.

- **Yadah Revitalizing Jelly Pack with Genseng: A.** Suuuper thick, jelly essence and tons of it. Sheet was really pliable and fit well. Left my skin incredibly soft and looking refreshed. Hydration was off the charts. 

- **It's Skin The Fresh Mask Sheet - Avocado: A.** Sheet was soft and pliable. Essence was very creamy and a little heavy and may be better for normal to dry skin. Left my skin very plump and bouncy.

- **CNP Laboratory Quick Soothing S.O.S. Mask: A.** Good quality sheet and plenty of essence. This one reduced redness more than just about any other I've tried.

- **Dr. Plus Banana Milk Mask: A.** I really didn't expect to like this one, and was very pleasantly surprised. The banana scent was pleasant and not overwhelming at all. It contained a ton of rich essence, and was very brightening and super-moisturizing. Left my skin incredibly soft.

- **Entia Vitamin B After Overwork Soothing Mask: A.** Had a very thick jelly essence. The sheet was great quality. Was very soothing and left me really hydrated.

- **Pack Age Everyday Bouncy: A.** High quality essence and sheet, and did an amazing number on the dullness I was having. My skin was left looking glowy and totally bouncy. 

- **Papa Recipe Bombee Black Honey Mask: A- or B+.** I didn't like this one as much as I expected to, but I want to try some of the other flavors. Smell was amazing, sheet and essence were fantastic quality, but I just didn't see any real results. Good for hydration only.


- **TonyMoly The Chok Chok Green Tea: B.** Sheet wasn't as high quality as some others, but contained lots of essence and definitely took care of my redness.

- **Skinfood Premium Lettuce &amp; Cucumber Watery Mask: B.** Sheet was good, but essence was very watery and drippy. I was having to constantly catch leaks from my chin area. Was incredibly effective at reducing irritation though.

- **It's Skin The Fresh Mask Sheet - Pomegranate: B.** Quality sheet, a little stingy on essence. No outstanding results, but did seem to calm acne a bit.

- **Wangskin White Flower: B.** Great quality all-around cheap mask. Good for a quick brighting and hydrating pickup.

- **Haruharu Moisture: B.** I didn't love the smell of this one, but the sheet was good quality, there was lots of essence, and skin felt bouncy afterwards.

- **Innisfree My Real Squeeze Mask - Lime: B.** Very brightening and good quality sheet. Was a little too drippy for my liking. I'd like to try more ""flavors"" of this.

- **My Beauty Diary Duo Intensive Moist - Black Pearl: B.** Tried this because of reviews here. It was nice, but just nice lol. It didn't brighten nearly as much as I expected, but it was adequate. 

- **MediHeal Cica:Ming: B.** Sheet was too stiff and difficult to make it fit correctly, but there was lots of serum and it reduced redness quite a bit.

- **The Face Shop The Solution Face Mask Pearl: B-.** Good quality sheet and helped redness, but very little essence. Could only leave it on for 10 minutes max and even that might have been too long.

- **Dr. Jart V7 Toning Mask: B-.** Sheet was high quality, lots of thick creamy essence, but had very little effect on my hydration level or redness. Not enough results for the cost imo.

- **Jayjun Intensive Shining Mask: B-.** Felt luxurious and had a lot of essence, but not enough results to justify the price for me.



**The rest of these all had grades of C-F, so I won't be as detailed with them or list individual grades.**

- **Skinfood Beauty In A Mask Sheet - Centella Asiatica:** Sheet was stiff and scratchy. Left face feeling tight.

- **Freeset Donkey Milk Skin Gel Mask Healing:** I'm still mourning the loss of this one. It was an HG until they reformulated, and I bought a box of 10 not realizing it had been changed. Sheet quality is horrible now and essence is watery and ineffective.

- **A'Pieu Milk One Pack - White:** Decent quality sheet, but essence was scarce. Lingering unpleasant milk smell was a hard no. I had to wash this off after I used it; I just couldn't stand it being on my face.

- **Dr. Young Young Clear and Glowing Sky Mask:** Sheet was thick and coarse. Very little essence. Subtle brighting but not enough to endure the experience of using this mask again.

- **Secret Key Snail Intensive Mask:** Somehow this one actually left my skin feeling drier than before I applied it. Nope.

- **Baroness Pomegranate:** Sheet felt like I slapped a piece of notebook paper on my face. Horrible fit and minimal essence. I won't repurchase any masks from this brand.

- **INSbyN AC Calming System Mask:** This one is supposed to calm redness and irritation, but it actually left my skin hot and red. It was a horrible experience. I had to apply my beloved RealBarrier mask immediately to make my skin somewhat normal again.

- **Leaders Juicy Mojito Clearing:** Sheet was an odd plasticy texture (wasn't a liner, I removed that). Skin felt dried out afterwards.

- **NoTS Soothing Multi Gel Mask:** Fragrance was waaaay over the top. Skin felt sticky for about 10 minutes after mask was removed, then it turned into this flaky-dry film on the skin. I had to wash it off.

Hearing all about Iunik (specifically the brand's propolis serum) I have been dying to try out the brand. I couldn't find Iunik's cruelty-free status on the AB cruelty-free spreadsheet, so I emailed the company a few questions:  

1. Are any Iunik products or ingredients of these products tested on animals?, 2. Does Iunik sell products in mainland China?, 3. Do any of Iunik suppliers or any third parties test on animals for Iunik?, 4. Is Iunik owned by a parent company that is not cruelty-free?

Here is Iunik's response:

 ""Hello

With this email we answer your questionnaires

1- No, our products &amp; ingredients are NEVER tested on animals. 

2- Our products are not sold directly in China on the ground however it's available to purchase our product online then we ship the items to customer 

3- Non of our distributor or retailer do not test the products on animal 

4- We are the main company we are not owned by any company

We hope our answer help you to make your questionnaire clear

510,AsianBeauty,Chinese testing laws: a clarification,"So recently it came to my attention that not many people understood the difference between selling to china or selling in china.  There’s a few laws to consider before considering a brand cruelty free even if they are somehow present in china. 

1) most obvious. Hong Kong does not require or demand animal testing so a brand that only in HK is still cruelty free. 
 
2) online sales to china. china allows imported products to not be tested on animals. 

“Companies can sell their products to the Chinese market through an online store without having their products tested on animals. China’s animal testing laws only requires imported cosmetics that are sold in a physical store in Mainland China.”

521,AsianBeauty,What product converted you from skeptic to believer?,"I'm thinking particularly about my experience with ampoules. I'd been using The Plant Base time stop collagen ampoule for a year (bought it during my hysterical AB youth when I bought things based on lists like THE BEST KOREAN PRODUCTS OF 2017!--lil baby didn't know a humectant from a preservative from denatured alcohol) and while it didn't feel bad, and the packaging was cool, it just seemed like expensive amber-colored mystery goo that I applied enthusiastically thinking *they said on the internet it had mushrooms like special mushroom powers this is the only thing with those special life-changing mushrooms i want the secret mushroom powers only for me!!!*, when really it did exactly zero for my skin.

There are a few other ampoules that filled my heart with cynicism and doubt, including Seantree's Hyaluron 100 ampoule (which was just a transparent, sort of thick, sort of wet, fully boring goo...that had a... temporary wetting sensation...*is this tap water's viscous cousin?*) I was prepared to call all ampoules BS!

Then, I met Coreana Ample: N Ceramide Shot Ampoule. It was $10. I bought it cause of the Ceramides and Prime Shipping.

Before I met this ampoule, my combo skin had a tendency (*thanks tret!*) to get dry and flaky on my cheeks, chin, and upper lip, unless I layered 2-3 moisturizing toners, and sealed my whole routine in with heavy creams (to which I'd need to add squalane oil) and an occlusive. It was a lot. I didn't hate it because I have a deep love for putting weird shit on my face with tremendous gravity and ceremonial intensity, but I hated seeing my cheeks dry out by the end of a long day after such a heavy and time consuming evening ritual of layering. I wondered, *Is AB even helping me*?

I use the Ceramide Ampoule night and day, but honestly, as someone who's lucky to apply sunscreen before running to work, mostly just at night, and it has eliminated my peely dry skin problem totally. And I can skip cream moisturizers entirely and still have no problems. A few drops of this cloudy white goo (NSFW!) have changed my skin entirely.

527,AsianBeauty,[Discussion] Sunscreen with AHA,"**Tldr; A’Pieu Pure Block Natural Sun Cream SPF 45 PA+++ (100ml) bottle states that it contains AHA and should be used with caution.** 

I've been using the A’Pieu Pure Block Natural Sun Cream SPF 45 PA+++ on and off for a while now. I originally got the smaller 50ml bottle, but quite liked the formula and decided to buy the bigger 100ml bottle. Sometimes after this I started worrying about the product irritiating my skin (my face appeared more flushed/red than it usually is), and I've been using it less lately.  

Now I just got my 100 ml bottle in the mail, and I noticed a strange caution note at the bottom (in english, not included on the 50ml bottle), saying:

&gt;\[...\] Sunburn alert: This product contains an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) that may increase your skin's sensitivity to the sun and particularly the possibility of sunburn. Use sunscreen, wear protective clothing and limit sun exposure while using this product and for a week afterwards.

Which made me *SUPER CONFUSED*, as this is supposed to be a daily sun screen??? I mean, what? A sunscreen that increases sun sensitivity? And which tells you to wear sunscreen while and after using it? (At least this could explain why my skin got slightly irritated after using this for a while.....)

So now I'm wondering if anyone else has experience with either this sunscreen or others that contain AHA. Will it still be a good protective product against sun damage? Is it a too complicated product trying to do too much at once, cancelling it's various effects out? Would an AHA in a sunscreen even function as an AHA, when applied as the last layer of a skincare routine?",t3_bvxx21

I discovered this today myself, when someone from Singapore on the AB reddit server pointed out that they couldn't find Retinol on their ingredient list of the Hada Labo Gokyjun Alpha Lotion (Red Packaging).

This product is still being marketed as having retinol by pharmacy stores such as [Watsons](https://www.watsons.com.sg/retinol-lifting-firming-lotion-170ml/p/BP_32641?text%3DLifting+Firming+Lotion%26page%3D0=), though [Guardian](https://www.guardian.com.sg/hada-labo-lifting-and-firming-lotion-170ml/p/153863) only markets [one](https://www.guardian.com.sg/hada-labo-retiniol-3d-gel-100g/p/170582) product in the range as having ""retiniol"" (sp). But the physical store still has the label claiming all the Goku-jyun Alpha products have retinol.

However, the [Hada Labo SG website](https://www.hadalabo.com.sg/antiageing-1) only lists **one** product in the Goku-jyun Alpha range as having retinol. I will have to check again to see if the Anti-aging + 3D Gel Moisturiser actually has retinol.

&amp;#x200B;

I have several questions:

1. Why is a different version of the product being sold in Singapore? (If it's because Singapore has tighter restrictions on retinoids, why are other products containing retinyl palmitate sold normally?)
2. Why are stores selling the Lifting+Firming Lotion (Rich) as having retinol, when it actually doesn't?
3. Is this incompetence, or intentionally false/misleading marketing?
4. Are there other regions selling the non-retinol version of the ""red"" range?",t3_bvn7nt

546,AsianBeauty,The SAEM's Eco Soul Glow Master Primer,"Hello all!

The product I am reviewing today is The Saem’s Eco Soul Glow Master Primer. I bought this primer about a month ago as a backup primer because I’m almost running out of my YSL Touche Eclat Primer. I know that YSL’s primer is not as comparable to The Saem’s Master Glow Primer because they perform differently on the skin, but I wanted to get a luminous primer for my more mattifying foundations. There are actually two other versions of primer in the Eco Soul line: Aqua Master and Pore Master if y’all are interested in trying them out.

&amp;#x200B;

**Packaging:**

The Saem’s Eco Soul Master Glow Primer came in a black cardboard box. The primer is 30 ml and stored in a white squeezy tube with a brown twist cap (I personally like pump bottles because I find I often squeeze more product out than I need, but it’s a minor complaint). The tube is small and compact, which is perfect for travelling or on the go. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Texture:** 

The consistency of the primer is very comparable to Korean/Japanese sunscreens/sun milks in that it is lightweight on the skin and absorbs really quickly. The Saem notes that the primer gives the illusion of brightness on the skin because there are “white and pink pearls” in it. The primer is white once squeezed out, but there’s a pinkish/purple-ish tint to it after you spread it out on your face. There’s no shimmer or glitter in the primer, but it gives off a subtle, brightening glow that really makes your skin look healthy and plump. The pinkish/purple-ish tint isn’t noticeable after you’ve applied your foundation and concealer. The primer has a subtle floral scent that dissipates quickly after application and wasn't reactive on my sensitive skin.

&amp;#x200B;

**Performance:**

I’ve worn this primer underneath my L’oreal Fresh Wear Foundation for about 8 hours and my face didn’t get too oily despite me having combo/oily skin. My foundation/concealer didn’t break up on my skin and looked pretty fresh by the end of the day. Although L’oreal markets Fresh War as giving a “fresh complexion that lasts”, I’ve found that it sits on top of my skin weirdly (especially on my textured/dry areas). The primer definitely improved look of the L’oreal Foundation and made it look more natural on my skin. The only con I have with this primer is that there’s not much pore blurring when I use it, but it definitely lives up to its Glow Master name.

&amp;#x200B;

**Verdict:**

For less than $10 USD, I would definitely recommend this primer for those who want a dewier complexion. The Saem’s Eco Soul Glow Master Primer can be worn on its own or underneath makeup and it’s extremely affordable compared to other similar products on the market.",t3_bved54

I first bought the cushion last Black Friday and purchased a refill kit (that comes with x2 refills). The refill is wayy affordable than the cushion compact, &amp; was happy that I was able to find such a good deal!! The compact costs USD$26.90 versus the 2-refills for USD$9. 

Unfortunately, it seems that they were clearing stocks for the refill as I realised that since last December they’ve been out of stock. This morning I checked the website, and there’s finally a sentence that writes that the refill has been discontinued.

The last batch of manufactured refills expires in Dec 2019, so I can’t even purchase from resellers! 

Just so frustrated that if I want to repurchase the BB Mochi Cushion (which I really love its formula &amp; skin-like finish), I’ll have to buy a WHOLE NEW compact!! Urgh!!!

552,AsianBeauty,Mid-Year Product Reviews,"My skintype: highly sensitive, combination (oily t-zone, dry u-zone) to normal, NC20-25

Environment: humid New York City in the summer, dry af New York City in the winter

WNR - would not repurchase

MRP - might repurchase

HG - holy grail

\*= broke out my sensitive skin but did show some effects, so it might work for you

**Cleansers:**

Kose Softymo Speedy (WNR) - aside from breaking me out (suspecting the mineral oil), it kinda sucks as a makeup remover imo It emulsifies pretty easily but it won’t remove eye makeup, and even lip makeup is a hassle to get off. This is a sub fav though, so YMMV

Tosowoong Enzyme Powder Wash (WNR) - I liked this when I first used it, because compared to the Rosette Cleansing Foam Green and SU:M37 Miracle Rose Cleansing Stick, this was much less drying, however, still a bit stripping. It still contains surfactants and I was a bit alarmed when I (accidentally) figured out it could also be used to remove blood stains off of white sheets like a clothing detergent.

Etude House Soon Jung 6.5 Cleanser (MRP) - currently a fav because it leaves only the sliiightest bit of dryness, but overall a pretty solid cleanser, only downside is that it has surfactants which may be too harsh for some. Unless I find one that’s even gentler than this and contains no surfactants, I might repurchase this.

**Toner:**

Secret Key Rose Base Toner (WNR) - THE FRAGRANCE. If you hate added fragrance, stay away. I don’t mind rose, as I love the Mamonde toner’s scent, but this one smells pretty awful. Like fake rose with a sprinkle of chemical. It’s also much stronger than the Mamonde’s and is slightly irritating for my skin. I regret purchasing this 500mL bottle that took forever to get through. Only convenient thing was because it was so watery, I could travel with it as a mist. If you don’t mind heavy fragrance and like light toners, you might enjoy this, although I don’t recommend it.

**Essences/Ampoules:**

2Sol Galactomyces Ampoule (WNR) - didn’t find this to do much for my skin, had decent hydration but I hated the feeling of it on my face, felt too greasy 

Cosrx Galactomyces 95 Whitening Power Essence (WNR) - much like the 2sol, I felt like this was all around, meh, didn’t notice any brightening with the 30mL sample I had, and I didn’t particularly enjoy the smell, so I stopped using it midway

**Treatments/Serums:**

Elizavecca Milky Piggy 100% Hyaluronic Serum (WNR) - Oh the packaging! It made me a total sucker for the product. Elegant and pretty. But that’s where the rave stops for me, personally. It felt like a normal essence-like product going on, but dried down into a weird film I could feel on my skin and also pilled at that point if I was still massaging the product into my skin. The film would make me feel more dry than before putting on the essence, so overall, I wouldn’t buy this again.

Melano CC Vitamin C Serum (WNR) - I really wanted to love this but it didn’t seem to do much for my skin. If it did fade away PIH, it wasn’t as quick as the Cosrx AHA for me, which took around 2 months for 80% fading.

Etude House Soon Jung Cica Balm (WNR) - didn’t find this to calm down my redness at all. However it did somewhat help cool and calm down my acne spots a bit. Nothing dramatic though, so I didn’t feel the need to repurchase. 

Non AB:

The Ordinary 10% Niacinamide + Zinc (WNR) - freaked my skin out into a bunch of cysts. Beware if you have sensitive skin. I noticed slight brightening, but I’m unsure if that was placebo. I stopped using it after 2 weeks once I noticed it caused cystic acne.

The Ordinary 30% AHA + 10% BHA (MRP) - had some pretty solid effects at making my skin feel smooth, and also helped to gradually fade PIH (took maybe 1 month). It did run out pretty quickly though, I went through the entire bottle with 2-3 times of use per week, in 2 months.

Timeless Vitamin C + E w/ Ferulic Acid (WNR\*) - I am so upset. It was a whole month that passed by while I was using it when I realized THIS was the product breaking me out in cysts. I thought it was due to finals stress, but nope, this stupid serum. It’s a well-loved product, so it’s probably just my super finicky skin unable to handle the 20% L-AA. I did notice some PIH lightening while using it, so give it a go if you can handle it. I’m beginning to think I should just stick with AHAs for brightening rather than vitamin C serums.

**Moisturizers:**

Muji Sensitive Skin Moisture Milk in Moisture (WNR) - a pretty nice lotion-esque product for moisture. I think those with dry skin would like this, however it does tend to pill if you don’t leave it alone after putting it on. It unfortunately broke me out, probably due to the essential oil in it. Alas, YMMV.

A'pieu Madecassoside Cream (WNR) - hated this so much. The scent was annoyingly citrusy, the texture felt too greasy on my skin, and it further caused me to break out due to the essential oils present in this product. I’d say stay away if you have sensitive skin.

**Sunscreen:**

It's Skin UV Away Moist Jumbo Sunblock SPF50 PA+++ (WNR) - I bought it due to the cost effectiveness of the product. Leaves a slightly white cast, but nothing too noticable on me. Would probably not work for those darker than NC25. It’s a pretty solid sunscreen, blends pretty easily in humid/hot weather. However if the air is even slightly dry, it’ll start pilling which is a pain in the ass if you have other steps in your routine before or after it. Due to this reason, and preferring to go for PA++++, I wouldn’t repurchase this.

BIORE UV Aqua Rich BB Essence Sunscreen SPF50+ PA++++ (WNR) - also works as a makeup base, since it leaves a light pink cast with very light coverage. It was too light and pink for me. Probably would only work for those lighter than \~NC15.

**Sheet Masks:**

I’ll preface this by saying I only use facemasks due to the inability to find a solid hydration step in my routine as of yet. But that may change soon due to the products I’m currently trying.

LIRIKOS Marine Energy Aqua Wrapping Mask (WNR) - I got sucked in by the packaging, let me remind myself to not do that again haha. It’s pretty moisturizing, with a unique gel-like essence. However it does have alcohol which my skin was slightly irritated by. It’s expensive for what it is, so I’d pass. 

Naruko Taiwan Magnolia Brightening and Firming Mask EX (WNR) - I did notice some brightening with this, however the essence made my face tight and I didn’t really feel as hydrated as I have with other sheet masks. It also \*might\* have broken me out. Overall a pass.

**Makeup:**

Holika Holika Jewel-light Waterproof Eyeliner (HG) - love this so much. I bought it in 2 colors, pink topaz (perfect for aegyo-sal) and olive topaz. They last very long (full 12 hour day’s worth), don’t really flake much on my undereyes. The price is right, and these are just beautiful!

3CE Mood Recipe Lipstick #218 Mirrorlike (WNR) - personally I found it too drying on my lips, exaggerating my cracks and lip lines in the process. For that price point I think it could do better.

The Saem Saemmul Mousse Candy Tint (HG) - I find these to be a slightly cheaper alternative to the Peripera Velvet tints. Similar formula, and I find these to have a better selection of colors too, albeit more concise. Longevity wise, I find them to be pretty similar to the Peripera, \~5 hours of wear before major fading. I purchased strawberry cheesecake, and then bought 2 more after loving that one: peanut and chai tea.

Peripera Sugar Twinkle Liquid Shadow in Kitten Beige (HG) - probably the most cost effective and closest dupe to the Stila Glitter &amp; Glows Liquid Eyeshadow that’s out there. Highly shiny, with big glitter flakes, pigmented, and the perfect rose gold color. It does flake when I use it on my undereyes, so proceed with caution there. Otherwise, it’s a great eyeshadow.

MACQUEEN Waterproof Pen Eyeliner in Dark Black (WNR) - very dark, nice precise tip, but can get flaky over the course of the day. For that reason it’s not terrible, but I wouldn’t repurchase. I found that my Etude House Oh My Line liner was less flaky (although I didn’t like its bulky brush-tip).

A'PIEU - Juicy-Pang Tint in Fig &amp; Persimmon (MRP) - I love the glossy and plump, gel-like finnish these have. However I wish they were more long-lasting (fade after \~3-5 hours of wear depending on the color, while leaving behind a slight stain) and had a wider color selection. Aside from that, I do like these.

**Haircare:**

KRACIE Ichikami Smoothing Hair Treatment (WNR\*) - made my wavy hair really shiny! Would recommend if you don’t break out from fatty alcohols like I do, once I found out I had to be super careful to only wash my hair and not bring any of the product on my face in the meantime.

Kracie ICHIKAMI Moisturizing Shampoo (WNR\*) - made my hair more nourished and shiny, but also has essential oils which I suspect also broke me out. But if you don’t have sensitive skin, give it a try!

**Still testing:** Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner, Cezanne Skin Conditioner High Moist and Hada Labo Shirojyun Premium (love this one the most so far due to its essence-to-water texture and glowy effect)",t3_bv19qv

557,AsianBeauty,Dr. Jart Cicapair Serum,"Hi all, first time reviewing a product on AB. Let me know if I'm missing any details.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**

I've always had redness on the apples of my cheeks. I thought it was natural blush. Got my first facial recently and the esthetician pointed out that I have sensitive skin, redness being one of the symptom. What?! Blew my mind, although it seems obvious now. Anyways, I did a little research and decided to try Cicapair. I chose the serum because I wasn't a fan of the colored Dr. Jart drops that are more popular.

&amp;#x200B;

**Details**

Brand:  Dr. Jart

Name: Cicapair Serum

Amount: 30ml / 1 oz

Price: $27 back in March, now $41 on Amazon. Here it is on [Sephora](https://www.sephora.com/product/tiger-grass-re-pair-serum-P423259).

&amp;#x200B;

**Usage**

I use about a half dropper  at night. I only put it on my cheeks because that's where my skin is most sensitive. It has a slightly thick but still watery consistency (no where near as thick as the Ordinary's niacinamide). A light medicinal smell that quickly goes away. No tackiness once it dries down.

**Results**The morning after I use this serum I definitely see the results. I have little to no redness on my cheeks.

&amp;#x200B;

**Food for Thought**

This product is effective for me. I like the twisty dropper (although I can see how others might now). Would I spend $40+ to repurchase it? No, I'm going try a few other  centella asiatica  products first.

560,AsianBeauty,[DISCUSSION] AB Skincare Products and Preservatives,"Hello~! 

So, after dealing with sensitive skin and unknown allergies all my life, I finally went ahead and had some allergy patch testing done. Turns out I'm extremely allergic to formaldehyde, which is unfortunately a fairly common ingredient in products (not just beauty ones). As follows, I'm also allergic to any compound that can release formaldehyde during breakdown. There are a few other preservatives I have allergies towards (e.g. benzalkonium chloride).

One of the main reasons I turned to Asian beauty is because the products tend to not irritate my skin. After inspecting labels like crazy the past few days, I've noticed that formaldehyde-related preservatives don't seem to be as prevalent in Asian beauty products. I've seen phenoxyethanol a lot more frequently.

Any insights to this? Is this an actually trend among Asian beauty products or am I just seeing this among the brands I tend to use?",t3_bv04z5
561,AsianBeauty,3CE Collection + Mini Review + A little Rant on the Brand,"Hello, finally I have recieved the last of my wanted 3CE Products, and since a lot of reviews on this sub are a little bit older, I'd like to review a couple myself. Half I purchased on my Japan trip, the other half I got directly from Stylenanda. I'm a 105 in Fenty/ Siberia in Nars, for reference.

.

.

3CE Stylenanda Back to Baby Make Up Base SPF 50 PA+++ (Purple): 3/5

I've stopped using this ever since I started using the Skin Aqua Tone Up UV Essence, since that already has a purple base. This thing is SUPER pigmented, so if you're not careful with application, it's easy to end up looking like Thanos. Other than that it doesn't really distrupt my foundation, so I think it's a nice color correcting product (and far cheaper than the Western options on the market). As for the primer part, I couldn't really tell whether it was particularily making the wear time longer or shorter as it's dries down on your skin like a liquid-y foundation would.

3CE Stylenanda Back to Baby Glow Beam (White): 3.5/5

I was really excited to try this, as I heard raving reviews about this beforehand. Turns out I had bought the Western option for this a couple months back already. Vice Versa, if you happened to enjoy NYX Born To Glow primer, but can't get your hands on them, get this one. Apart from Glow Beam being a bit thicker in consistency, they do the same thing. It's a solid products and you really only need a little bit to make your skin look more dewy. A great option for people with dry skin especially! I don't have any matte foundations laying around currently, but I mixed this with a pretty drying concealer, and it still worked well!

3CE Blush in SHY SHY: 4/5

Not much to say about this blush to be honest, it's solid and it does it's job. You can build it up and it will last you the entire day. It's supposed to be more neon, but it looks more baby pink on my cheeks. If you're into blush it's worth checking out, but considering it's the price of a MAC blush, there are a lot cheaper options on the Kbeauty market that perform just as well!

3CE Blush in ALLURING (Red Collection): 4/5

Same thing as SHY SHY. The one I have is a very blue toned red, so it slightly washes me out, but not enough that I would mind. It also makes for a great eyeshadow.

3CE Mood Recipe Multi Eye Color Palette in OVERTAKE: 3/5

I've always wanted to own one of their 9 pan eyeshadow palettes, pretty much the only product I had on my wishlist from them for the longest time. I bought overtake believing it was the coolest one out of the Mood Recipe line, but it's actually the warmest eyeshadow palette I have in my collection. I think this palette is the one I'd recommend for deeper skin tones the most, but I also honestly can't justify the price enough to give this a higher rating. The mattes are ok, similar to their blush formulas actually, but the glitters/shimmers barely show up, almost like they need the top layer scraped off first. I came for the color story, and I get that a wash of color is part of the aesthetic. but I still expected a little bit more from a 40€ palette, to be honest.

3CE Mood For Blossom Multi Eye Color Palette in BEACH MUSE: 3/5

Similar to Overtake, the product I wanted the most from their recent collection was easily the eyeshadow palette. With a mixture of both warm peach tones and cool mauve tones I knew this palette was made for me. I love it, not gonna lie, but it being perfect for me is also a massive downside. The shades all have a white base to them, so they're going to look off on anyone who's not fair or at most a light medium. I've seen Darcei review this and the shades looked super ashy on her, along with most of the products from the line, so consider your skin tone when buying this one. The quality of the eyeshadows is similar to Overtake, and for the price you're probably better off buying one of the many peach toned palettes that came out at the same time.

3CE Take a Layer Multipot in CABBAGE ROSE 5/5:

I bought this shade in particular because I was worried HOLLYHOCK was going to look too similar to SHY SHY, but now I actually regret not getting hollyhock too. Cabbage Rose is a beautiful dried rose shade that blends effortlessly across my eyes and cheeks. You don't need a lot either, and I've seen that it works well across a LOT of skin tones on Youtube.  It lasted well through my 6-8 hour Uni day. I wouldn't recommend it for the lips without a lot of prep, since it is super matte. If I had to reccomend one product from all of Stylenanda to you, I would say get the Multipots. This is going to last me an eternity, if I store it correctly.

3CE Take a Layer Tinted Water Tint in FIG PINK: 4.5/5

I had grabbed this in store not really knowing anything about it. It's a water tint but it reminds me more of the Etude House Gel Water Tints than the Peripera Water Tints! It's probably the most staining water tint I've tried to this day, as it's pretty much impossible to get off your lips (and skin) without a scrub. Really recommend it for people that want to enjoy a very pigmented tint. If you want to achieve the same effect as Park Sora on the picture, you have to apply a clear gloss over it though.

3CE Velvet Lip Tint in PINK BREAK, BEST EVER, ABSORBED 4/5:

Not much to say about these, they're really as comfortable and nice to wear as everyone else on this sub already mentioned. I originally only bought Absorbed, but I was so fascinated by the texture and wear that I went back to the store two days later to buy the other two shades. They don't really dry down, hence why they're not transfer proof, but they do stay quite a while on your lips! If you like matte finishes, but dislike how dry their bullet lipsticks are, definitely get one or two of these!

3CE Smoothing Lip Tint in DOLLYFIED 1.5/5:

These came out while I was waiting for their free shipping event, and I find that neon-ish lip products look pretty flattering on me, so I threw this in the cart to try it.

Make no mistake. I'm neutral-yellow leaning in undertone, I've never had a pink toned lip product turn up orange on me. This is straight up orange. So orange that I was worried I had purchased Best Day by accident. I also get why they called these Smoothing Lip Tints; you can taste the silicone if you apply this on your lips. So much that it's kind of nauseating. They feel like a cheaper knock-off off the Velvet Lip Tints. They're more pigmented than the Velvet Lip Tints, but also super patchy when applied. Make it make sense!!!  I advice against paying 20 bucks for these.

.

.

Overall, I enjoy 3CE very much, but I have to be real. A lot of their money is in the packaging and marketing, not in the actual product. The quality of most of their products is nothing outstanding that can't be found for cheaper on the market. If I had to call Glossier the American take on Korean beauty trends and preferences, I'd call 3CE the Korean take on American beauty trends and preferences. I think tnat sums it up best.

.

.

This is a bit off-topic, but since 3CE is especially famous for their color products, I wish they stopped having Park Sora main model every single release, or at least provide swatch photos that weren't made by blackfacing Park Sora's arm. The other model has the same skin tone, so I'm confused why she's used as the only other reference for the customer in the first place. Asians, even South Koreans, don't all come in her skin tone, and the brand would benefit greatly from hiring more Asian models with varying skin tones. People like Hayley Kim would fit the brand aesthetic perfectly, and it's not like Stylenanda is a struggling Indie-Brand at this point. They KNOW they have a global fanbase, and they're owned by LOreal; it can't be that hard to find at least 3 models that are in the medium, tan and dark range. I also get that its kind of their thing, but they really do rarely allow their products to be shown in any other setting than SUPER BRIGHT SUN LIGHT.  You really have to go by other reviews if you want to know how their products look in real life.

562,AsianBeauty,Is wanting brighter/lighter skin problematic?,"So I just finished watching a Refinery29 video about skin bleaching in the Philippines. It was really sad to me risks that people would take to get lighter skin and it just got me thinking about the subject of colorism. Bare in mind I don’t actually want to talk about the video, it was just what made me think about this topic in the first place. 

I’m a Caucasian person living in the States. I’ve already got a decently light skin tone, I’m usually able to use the lightest shade in most foundation ranges no problem. However, I’m still always looking for products that will help brighten/lighten my skin further. I also wear sunscreen religiously and I hate the thought of catching a tan. Being as pale as I can is just what makes *me* feel beautiful. I think I look the best that way. It’s just a personal preference for myself. I don’t think it’s the only way to be beautiful and I most certainly don’t think other people with darker complexions are ugly or worth less than myself, that’s so far from the case. 

Any way, the video just raised some questions in me regarding my beauty preferences for myself. Am I contributing to colorism by holding this desire? Have I made people feel bad or worth less by stating I don’t want tan skin when I’ve been asked about my favorite self tanner or told I should try one? Is it wrong of me to state that preference in a situation like that? 

Idk, this whole post could be much ado about nothing but I’m interested in starting a discussion and hearing people’s different points of view on the subject.",t3_buk330

[Colour Lip Stain Matte Fluid in BR01 Toffee Nut ](https://i.redd.it/tc3e5vye9x031.jpg)

I've been looking high and low for a brown lippie that was an AB brand and just the other day, I received this in the mail. Since I couldn't really find many reviews on this lippie, I decided to write a review to share my thoughts.

The lipstick bottle is pretty elegant looking and appears to be glass but in actual fact, it's all plastic. Great news for me because I tend to drop and break things. 

 

[Applicator - this is a horrible photo ](https://i.redd.it/u2cdd80sax031.jpg)

The doe foot applicator is pretty standard, slanted on one side but a little larger than most doe foot applicators. There's also the standard separator in the bottle to limit the amount of product that comes out of the bottle onto the applicator. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Hand Swatch](https://i.redd.it/n45d96v8bx031.jpg)

The shade BR01 Toffee Nut is a warm brown shade with a hint of orange. It also becomes darker when fully dried.

&amp;#x200B;

[Lip Swatch](https://i.redd.it/pu9ked51cx031.jpg)

The A'pieu Colour Lip Stain Matte Fluid is a matte liquid lipstick that thankfully, does not suck all the moisture out of your lips. Surprisingly, the texture is fairly creamy but it dries down matte and this formula will cling onto dry patches. There is also a powdery scent upon application but it fades off within 5 minutes or so. My lighting was wonky in this photo but the lip swatch is a tad darker than what is shown in the photo.

I wore this for a good 5-ish hours. It did not transfer when I was drinking water but it started to disintegrate when I had lunch (shoyu ramen for context) and by the time I had finished lunch, it had nearly disintegrated which warranted a reapplication. The lippie did not stain my lips.

Although this may not be the most long-lasting lippie, I'd probably repurchase because it's cheap, it does not dry my lips out too badly and the colour is beautiful. Hopefully, this was helpful for anyone considering purchasing this lippie!",t3_btya13

582,AsianBeauty,"[Science] Sunscreen questions with Korean suncare chemist/researcher, Kim Sung Yong.","Hello! :) I translated some of the things discussed in the video. Please let me know if I got anything wrong if you read/speak Korean.

[**The interview takes place at ""Korea's best cosmetics developer: Cosmax"".**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KP01CSuwkA8&amp;list=LLMkaVDRp73TVN_kiVmUiETw&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s) The interviewee is chemist/researcher ""Kim Sung Yong"", the director of the part of the lab that develops suncare.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q: Should we reapply sunscreen every two hours?**

A: When you are at a place you will get a lot of sun or the beach, you should reapply every two hours. But if you're indoors/not getting a lot of sun, it's not super important that you reapply at exactly every two hours. If you wear makeup, you can use cushion sunscreens to reapply.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q: Should you always wear sunscreen underneath cushion foundation?**

A: No.

**Q: Really?? I am so surprised. I thought that you have to wear sunscreen underneath even if you are wearing SPF 50 PA+++ makeup because you wouldn't use as much of it as you would sunscreen! I'm happy I don't have to.**

A: It's not necessarily that you don't have to put it on, if you want higher protection, you should wear sunscreen underneath. That's obviously the best way. Whether it's sunscreen or makeup, if it has a SPF 50 PA+++ rating, it has the same protection. But if you're not going to put on a lot of it all over your face, then you should apply sunscreen first, then add additional sun protection with cushion (foundation) on top.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q: Does everyone really have to put on 500 Won (Korean 50 cent coin) size of sunscreen (on face) to get adequate protection?**

A: In my opinion, 500 Won size is a lot. There are so many different kinds of sunscreens in regards to thickness/density/textures so you can't be sure how much you actually need. The important thing is to use as much as your skin can absorb. Like when I put sunscreen on my kids, I don't dump it all out on the back of my hand and try to put on all of it at once. I dot a bunch of sunscreen all around their faces and rub in and repeat until their skin can't absorb any more.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q: Do you have to wait 30 minutes after putting on sunscreen to go outside?**

A: Yes. The most important thing is that your skin must have absorbed an adequate amount of sunscreen and that it is evenly spread across your skin. It doesn't matter much if you are reapplying when you go outside, but if you're leaving for the first time that day, you will get the most protection if you give your sunscreen enough time to absorb and form a protective film.

**Q: Does that mean sunscreen doesn't offer protection right away after you apply?**

A: No, it does give protection. It's just that if you're applying AFTER you went outside already, it won't be as protective as if you put it on before.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q: Do you tan even with light from your electronics (like phone/computer)? Should we be using sunscreen indoors?**

A: Yes. You can assume that UVA rays (Edit:/blue light/visible light?) exist everywhere. When we gathered data about this issue, we found that you would be getting *at least* 30% of UVA at any given time. So wherever you are, you should always be using at least a very light sunscreen on your skin. At least SPF 20 or 30 is a good idea.

**Q: Does that mean I have to put it on even at home?**

A: Well, yes it's a good idea. Think of it as using all your other basic skin care. There are many sunscreens on the market that feel very light. Just like you would use lotion/cream to moisturize regularly. You don't have to go super high or heavy. Just SPF 20 or 30 is fine.

**Q: I don't tend to use sunscreen at home, especially on my body. So if I'm thinking long term, something like 10-20 years from now, is that something I should worry about?**

A: Well, you know summer brings heat with it? There is skin damage that comes from heat itself as well. When you think of farmers working outdoors for 10-20 years, you can see how much damage that does to their skin. So it's kind of important to use sunscreen even on your body if you want to avoid that. \[They go back and forth about how shitty it is getting sunscreen on clothes.\] You really should pick a feather-light sunscreen that doesn't leave any residue.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q: Is sunscreen more/less protective depending on the texture?**

A: No. The regulations are different in each country, but in terms of our country, we can get approval and our products tested. This allows us to come out with a wide variety of textures/products. There *are* some differences between thin and thick sunscreens though. For example, very watery sunscreens have a tendency to come off easier. So it will be more protective and to your benefit to apply a thicker layer. In general, thicker is a bit better than thinner if you're really worried about sun damage. However, the most imperative thing is to pick a sunscreen that suits your skin the best. One that you will use generously. *That* will be your best sunscreen.

\[They talk about different formulations - lotion, cream, gel. Stuff about emulsifiers, water-in-oil formulations, and oil-in-water formulations. W/O being thicker and heavier &amp; O/W being thinner and more spreadable. That there are more O/W sunscreen in the market than W/O. At the beach, W/O sunscreens are the best (more waterproof). If you're having a hard time telling which kind you have, he says the easy way to find out at home is to squeeze some sunscreen into a cup of water. Then mix. Oil-in-Water sunscreens will just mix into the water easily. Water-in-Oil sunscreens tend to remain in goops and float.\]

**Q: More people are looking for stick sunscreens like this.**

A: There are lightweight, invisible sunscreen sticks like this, sun sticks that leave a little white cast like this, that feels thicker and silkier. It's important that you over-apply (more than you'd think you need) because they are so invisible. These sticks don't have water in them. So they're good for heavier protection during summer and when you'll be sweating a lot or swimming.

**Q: In my mind, the invisible, lightweight one will have less water resistance than the thicker one. Is that true?**

A: A little, yes. However, as I keep saying, the more important factor is how much more you will layer on.

&amp;#x200B;

\[Some stuff about physical and chemical sunscreens. Basic stuff.\]

&amp;#x200B;

**Q: Is it really important that we double cleanse when using just sunscreen?**

A: Yes. It's like makeup. Taking it off is more important than putting it on. Water in Oil formulations will be tougher to remove. You can use a cleansing oil first to get everything off. Though it won't kill you if you sleep without removing everything. Many people wear makeup for 8-10 hours a day. However, getting it off thoroughly is still highly important.

**Q: Can you tell us the best cleaner/way to remove everything?**

A: Ah,, I don't think I'm the best person to ask,, other chemists who specialize in developing cleansers will be better suited to answer this, haha.

**Q: Then I guess we should interview someone else from that branch! I have been advised to use a cleansing oil or cleansing water for the first step. Then follow up with a foaming cleanser.**

A: Hm, unless the cleansing water is of some *exceptional* formula, you probably shouldn't use waters to remove your sunscreen. It may work for oil-in-water formulations, but it will be difficult to remove water-in-oil (waterproof) sunscreens.

&amp;#x200B;

\[Stuff about higher SPF &amp; PA ratings/the difference between SPF &amp; PA.\]

\[They talk about how it's impossible to cover 100% of your skin with sunscreen.\]

&amp;#x200B;

**Q: Do sunscreens lose effectiveness/cancel each other out if you use more than one product with sunscreen?**

A: Not necessarily.

**Q: So if I were to put on SPF 30 sunscreen before going out, and then touched up later with an SPF 50 cushion, then would I be getting SPF 50 overall?**

A: Yes, you could say that.",t3_btwc8b

623,AsianBeauty,[Review] Brightening Powerhouse: Desiray Tranexamic Acid 10%,"&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Let me introduce to you, [Desiray DIY Tranexamic Acid 10%!](https://shopee.sg/product/139562306/2210614772?smtt=0.0.9) My new darling.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a Taiwanese made to order product, and expires in within 180 days of manufacturing.

&amp;#x200B;

I brought it for brightening PIH and overall tone, since I'm riddled with awful scars and spots thanks to a horrific bout of cystic acne. I've been all but languishing in an all-time low pit of worries in regards to my skin since last November. It was a never-ending cycle of playing whack-a-mole with each new cystic breakout. To add to that, I develop scars and spots easily even without touching. As long as a pimple forms, it leaves a purplish mark in its wake. And as I eased steadily into Differin to combat the unusual non-stop breakout, the purge simply added its own signature marks behind.

&amp;#x200B;

Gee, I felt bad when the beloved, supportive family of mine commented lightly. And they saw to it that I took skincare seriously this time, not being wishy-washy and skimping on my routine due to laziness and lack of discipline. Oh, and slapping on anything and everything without patch testing. Lesson learned.

&amp;#x200B;

So when, on a daily ritual of searching up new products on Shopee, I chanced upon this, I completely flipped and spazzed for days as I saved up coins and coupons, as well as researched the brand and MTL-ed their [website](https://desiray.com.tw), FB &amp; TW blogs before buying it. *(I can't Chinese.)*

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty much got the gist that they're entirely legit, has a university-backed research team &amp; lab and that their stuff worked! Went ahead and purchased TXA over Alpha Arbutin, since TXA has been well documented for melasma and I intended to make my mom a test subject.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This is straight up, pure TXA. Apparently using water as solvent the only ingredient. Could be that the TXA powder itself already has a preservative. Instructions are to mix it into a skincare product of choice in a 1:1 ratio, fresh each time, as a booster, not straight up adding them into the skincare products' containers. Or straight on its own. They've provided a pipette, with markings from 0.5 ml to 3ml.

&amp;#x200B;

I've used it for almost three weeks so far, am &amp; pm, sometimes pm only, mixing \~0.5-1ml into TO's Niacinamide Zinc. I find that using it solely on its own leaves behind a very matte finish and tightening sensation.

&amp;#x200B;

Y'all, this stuff is the elusive leprechauns's pot o' gold at the rainbow's end, showered with kitten tears and pixie dust.

&amp;#x200B;

My PIH have vanished halfway so dramatically I'm honestly in awe and so, so grateful and pleased with the progress. The dark angry reddish/purplish brown spots covering every inch of my cheeks have downsized three times smaller, and faded to soft pinkish red speckles and my face is a notch brighter all around. I didn't take pics, but a number of you know I've been at my wits' end with increasing PIH and cystic hell. My despair have made its round through the grapevine. Totally worth breaking my no-buy. I'm now a girl full of hopes once more.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Case comparison: I'm not using LAA but I do alternate between AHA *(does a bit at brightening)* &amp; Differin *(doesn't do squat for brightening)*, while my mom simply uses the TXA as her sole brightening product. Her more than a decade-old melasma are fading ever so steadily but surely, something that two years of TO Retinol in Squalane, a year of LAA, a bottle of TO Alpha Arbutin &amp; two bottles of TO Niacinamide Zinc tried to accomplish but only succeeded somewhat.

&amp;#x200B;

But TXA has been an absolute champ, a gamechanger. Those stubborn melasma patches are slowly breaking down much faster and blurring away into nothingness. And I really look forward to the end of September to see the full effects of it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In short, **ladies of SG, please run, don't walk, to Deisray** on Shopee and grab their Tranexamic Acid 10% ! And perhaps, their Kojic Acid 10% &amp; Aplha Arbutin 10% while you're at it!

630,AsianBeauty,IOPE New Derma Repair Cica Cream Is Miraculous,"So, I posted about this in rants and raves, but I’m afraid some members who don’t check that thread might miss out on a pretty amazing product.

The backstory: My boyfriend works construction and handles a lot of weird dangerous products, i.e. fiberglass, tar, splintery plywood, etc. Three fingers on both of his hands have developed this thick, bumpy, itchy, plaque-like rash with what appeared to be tiny little pitted holes. The rash would darken in color and split open as well. We’ve tried everything. Antibiotic and antifungal ointments thinking it was from sweating in his gloves, moisturizers and salves thinking his fingers were just badly dry, we slathered on snail products and bandaged them up trying to protect them. This has been going on for more than six months and not one single thing has worked or showed improvement.

Fast forward, this week, I ordered IOPE Derma Repair Cica cream, opened it right away, and tested it on the back of my hand. It’s very balmy and yet light. I grabbed his hands and started rubbing it into his fingers the way I have with every other product we’ve tried. The next day he came home from work and his fingers were completely healed! COMPLETELY HEALED. No bumps, no cracks, the skin was more pliable, no itching and irritation. He’s been using it for three days now and his fingers continue to heal and soften. He himself was so blown away he said he wished we had taken before and afters. 

I bought it for $20 on Amazon. The seller Saint Martins sells authentic products and so does Cala Comte. If anyone is looking for a new cica or centella product, I can’t recommend this one enough. The results are unparalleled. His fingers were so, so beat up. I personally will most likely be using it as a sleeping mask or night time moisturizer when my skin is stressed.",t3_brujy3

652,AsianBeauty,[Review] Anessa perfect BB base beauty booster SPF50+/PA++++,"I picked this product up quite by accident. I actually meant to grab the regular gold bottle to try but I was super sleep deprived (just flew from NYC to Singapore), forgot which color the regular sunscreen that everyone raves about was, and picked this up instead. I couldn't find many reviews about it so I thought I'd do my part and leave one because I ended up really liking this product.

&amp;#x200B;

Cost:

\- SGD $24.72/25ml from Watsons

For comparison, the regular gold bottle Anessa Perfect UV Sunscreen Skincare Milk is listed at SGD $27.93/60ml 

&amp;#x200B;

Ingredients: 

DIMETHICONE･ALCOHOL･ZINC OXIDE･WATER (AQUA)･METHYL METHACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER･ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE･DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE･CAPRYLYL METHICONE･TITANIUM DIOXIDE (CI 77891)･BUTYLENE GLYCOL･OCTOCRYLENE･HDI/TRIMETHYLOL HEXYLLACTONE CROSSPOLYMER･DEXTRIN PALMITATE･SILICA･TRIFLUOROPROPYLDIMETHYL/TRIMETHYLSILOXYSILICATE･DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE･PETROLATUM･TITANIUM DIOXIDE･ISODODECANE･PEG-9 POLYDIMETHYLSILOXYETHYL DIMETHICONE･PPG-17･IRON OXIDES (CI 77492)･MICA･BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE･ALUMINUM HYDROXIDE･ISOSTEARIC ACID･IRON OXIDES (CI 77491)･DISTEARDIMONIUM HECTORITE･STEARIC ACID･TRISODIUM EDTA･PEG/PPG-14/7 DIMETHYL ETHER･POLYSILICONE-2･LITHIUM MAGNESIUM SODIUM SILICATE･FRAGRANCE (PARFUM)･BHT･TOCOPHEROL･LIMONENE･GLYCERIN･SODIUM METABISULFITE･IRON OXIDES (CI 77499)･LINALOOL･SODIUM ACETYLATED HYALURONATE･

(list taken from watsons website)

&amp;#x200B;

UV filters:

\- Zinc Oxide, Octinoxate, Titanium Dioxide, Octocrylene, Uvinul A Plus, Tinosorb S

&amp;#x200B;

Claims:

\- supposed to be good for sports

\- non-sticky and shine-free look

\- sweat and water resistant

&amp;#x200B;

Finish:

Satin, though depending on what you layer underneath it can be quite dewy. On it's own it's quite a natural finish but I usually layer it over Stratia liquid gold and the Soon Jung 2x barrier cream, both of which are fairly dewy. Even so the end result with this bb base was a glowy look that didn't cross the line to oily. It sets pretty well on its own, but I found that I needed to powder it a bit mainly due to what I was layering underneath. Without powdering it did crease a little bit on my eye area though again, I believe that's mainly due to my layers underneath. Also, creasing of products on my eye area is also fairly normal for me due to my lid shape.

I was also worried about this being drying due to the alcohol but found it to be ok. I recently started tret so my skin has been SUPER dry but this didn't dry me out more, which I really appreciated.

Also, I was really happy that this was not streaky at all even when applied with my fingers.

&amp;#x200B;

Consistency:

Fairly watery, though it's not running off my hand or anything. It's very thin and spreads easily. This is more oily than sticky on initial feel, but once it dries down a bit it just feels like moisturized skin to the touch. It's very light and I don't feel like I'm wearing anything at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Coverage:

This had surprisingly high coverage. I was expecting it to be fairly sheer just going off the consistency but this was actually more high coverage than my usual tinted moisturizer (Laura Mercier oil-free). I have a fair amount of scarring on my cheeks from cystic acne and I would say this covered up about 90% of it. It was enough coverage that I don't find myself reaching for any additional concealer or foundation products. I also didn't get any weird texture or patchiness on my nose area which tends to be an issue for me. [Here](https://imgur.com/qpbc7lB) is a picture of my cheek scarring with just moisturizer. [Here](https://imgur.com/wq3ZpDl) is the same cheek with the Anessa. In the pictures, my face appears to have a bit of a whitecast, but if you look at the ""bare skin"" pic my face is already slightly lighter than my neck, probably because I don't always bring my sunscreen down on my neck like I'm supposed to 😬

&amp;#x200B;

Color:

I bought the shade natural.

So my closest foundation match is the non-AB shade Punjab from NARS. It's described as ""medium with golden undertones"". My closest AB match is the Missha M Magic Cushion in #27. This bb cream was nearly a perfect match for me. I'm not too sure how it would look on people significantly lighter or darker on my skintone though given that the coverage is fairly high. [Here](https://imgur.com/T7q5tQp) is what the Anessa looks like right out of the bottle. I was pretty surprised by how dark it looks. [Here](https://imgur.com/SkxJdCE) is what it looks like spread out on the back of my hand. You can kinda see it did make my hand look the slightest bit orange, which I think is because the dot amount was too much for the back of my hand, but it makes me think this could work for someone who may even be a couple shades darker than I am.

&amp;#x200B;

Staying Power:

I was pleasantly surprised by how well this sunscreen kept up throughout the day. I was a little worried about transferring (especially since I had it layered over the Soon Jung barrier cream which is somewhat greasy) but was pretty pleased by how little it transferred. [Here](https://imgur.com/moXVdEf) is a picture of a transfer test I did. This was about 30 min after applying. I pressed the paper towel firmly to each section of my face twice (cheeks, nose, forehead, chin). Even though a bit of color does come off on the paper towel there weren't any noticeable patches missing on my face. Even after a long day in very humid and hot Singaporean weather the coverage looks really good. When I sweat and dab my face off I do get a tiny bit of transfer, but nothing crazy.

&amp;#x200B;

Other things to note:

\- this does have a bit of a floral fragrance to it. It fades after application but is noticeable when you first apply, so that's something to take note of if you are averse to fragrance. I will say though that despite the fragrance and despite alcohol being fairly high in the list I didn't experience any irritation or breakouts. I started tret a week or so ago and am currently experiencing a fair amount of stinging even with basic moisturizing products so I was really surprised that I didn't experience any stinging from the Anessa.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall:

I am a huge fan of this product. The color, coverage, and finish are all perfect for me and I really appreciate the UVB/UVA ratings as well as the water and sweat resistance. I do wish it was a bit cheaper, but tbh this one product has replaced my usual combo of sunscreen + tinted moisturizer so I'll really be saving money in the long run. I haven't even reached for my concealer anymore so that's one more product I may (potentially) be able to cut out. Plus it's one less step for me to do in the morning which is always great. 10/10 will be buying again and this has replaced my previous holy grail sunscreen which was the Biore UV watery essence. I plan on getting the regular gold bottle Anessa sunscreen when this runs out just to see how similar they are, but for now I'm really happy with the bb base.

666,AsianBeauty,A search for Evercos Hanbang mask replacement - Sooyeonhoo mask review (long),"A bit of backstory.

Back in the old days of 2015, when I was just an AB baby I mainly gravitated to 2 sheet masks - Tosowoong Propolis and Benton High Content Snail. They had soothing ingredients and the fragrance was unobtrusive. Both of them were kind to my acne and speeded up healing and I discovered that a good sheet mask can give you a great, almost meditative experience.

Fast forward a few months and Snow White and the Asian Pear, one of the OGs of this sub, was posting about Hanbang in K-beauty - traditional herbal medicines being incorporated into cleansers, serums, masks etc. Among them was a post about Evercos masks, fully named Luxury Bogam Herbal Clinic Sheet Mask. I read those posts over and over while I was making up my mind, thinking “They can’t really be this good, right?”

Finally, in 2016, I suffered less from acne and more from post-acne marks that would linger for months. All the rage those days was licorice extract, famed for its ability to even out skin and remembering that one of the flavors of the Evercos masks was licorice, I finally took the plunge. This was back when 11st offered huge shipping discount coupons, so after all the fees and discounts, I managed to snag 40 masks for about $2 CAD each (mainly licorice but a few of each kind).

I was in love. These masks had a thick essence and an incredible fit on my huge face - a super thin mask sheet that was a second skin in ways that hydrogels promised (but never delivered). They would remain wet for 40 mins in the dry winter air and my skin was visibly plump and hydrated the next morning. The ingredients were great and the fragrance was subtly herbal and super relaxing. I would layer serums under them and the absorption of them was heightened and my face was never too sticky for the pillow again. Their packaging was beautiful, even though later on they went with a more minimalistic, matte aesthetic. I kept repurchasing them throughout 2017 and the first half of 2018, mainly from Gmarket.

When I finally ran out of these masks last winter, I noticed that the listings I’ve been buying these masks from have disappeared. I searched far and wide, searching 11st, Gmarket and various other sites in both English and Korean, trying to figure out why Evercos vanished. Eventually, I found that the company who used to manufacture these perfect yet affordable masks has discontinued them and instead there were these Sooyeonhoo masks in a similar aesthetic - minimalistic, Hanbang, matte. Even though there was barely any info about them on the internet, I ordered 20 of each of the Ginseng and Pearl &amp; Mulberry (whitening), hoping to recreate the experience of my favorite Licorice and Ginseng Evercos masks.

I started 0.025 tretinoin in the Canadian winter and in the meantime, I’ve been using Japanese bulk sheet masks like Lululun, Japan Gals and Kose Clear Turn which were fragrance-free and somewhat hydrating but nowhere near Evercos. Once I finally found a seller who didn’t claim that each mask had a shipping weight of 400g (making the shipping fee for 40 over 100 CAD), I placed my order on April 3rd and received it on April 8th (5 days babyy) totalling $83 CAD for 40 masks.

It’s been about a month of me using them on non-tret days (every other day). First off, ingredients.

**RED GINSENG NOURISHING:**

Aqua, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Benzyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Raspberry Ketone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-10 Myristate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Adenosine, Beta-Glucan, Panax Ginseng Root Extract (500ppm) Trichosanthes Kirilowi Fruit Powder, Allium Tuberosum Seed Extract, Prunus Persica (Peach) Kernel Extract, Thuja orientalis Extract, Zizyphus Jujuba Fruit Extract, Castanea Sativa (Chestnut) Seed Extract, Coix Lacryma-Jobi Ma-yuen Seed Extract, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Extract, Kyounin Yu, Cnidium Monnieri Fruit Extract, Xanthan Gum, Butylene Glycol, Allantoin, Panthenol, Disodium EDTA, Dipotassium Glycyrhizate, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Fragrance.

**PEARL MULBERRY ROOT BRIGHTENING:**

Aqua, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Benzyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Raspberry Ketone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-10 Myristate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Adenosine, Beta-Glucan, Pearl Extract(880ppm), Morus Alba Bark Extract(870ppm), Trichosanthes Kirilowi Fruit Powder, Allium Tuberosum Seed Extract, Prunus Persica(Peach) Kernel Extract, Thuja Orientalis Extract, Zizyphus Jujuba Fruit Extract, Castanea Sativa(Chestnut) Seed Extract, Coix Lacryma-Jobi Ma-yuen Seed Extract, Sesamum Indicum(Sesame) Seed Extract, Kyounin Yu, Cnidium Monnieri Fruit Extract, Xanthan Gum, Butylene Glycol, Allantoin, Panthenol, Disodium EDTA, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Fragrance.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My favorite thing about the Evercos masks was that each mask would contain 1% of the extract in its title (licorice, ginseng, etc), however Sooyeonhoo masks contain much less of the star ingredient. Each mask contains a variety of herbal extracts, a minute amount of licorice-derived dipotassium glycyrrhizate and a fair amount of niacinamide.

The mask material itself is thicker and the essence is thinner compared to previous Evercos masks, which makes the fit a bit worse. The mask sheet is still quite wide which is great for people with larger than standard faces (me). The mask stays wet for at least half an hour.

The ginseng mask smells like the Evercos ginseng mask, but a bit stronger but the pearl mulberry is much more floral and perfumey. I miss those subtle earthy herbal smells of the old masks.

Performance - moisturizing, non-irritating but not much else. I have niacinamide in quite a few of my skincare steps, so not much brightening resulted from their use. I don’t think I will repurchase these in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

I will keep looking for the holy grail ultra thin translucent sheet with thick essence, bomb hanbang ingredients and a subtle fragrance mask...the search continues.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Original Luxury Bogam Herbal Clinic Sheet Masks ruined me for any other sheet masks and the new Sooyeonhoo offering is a pale imitation. Why were they discontinued, why? :(",t3_bqc3af

&amp;#x200B;

I have been using Krave Beauty [Kale-lalu-yAHA](https://kravebeauty.com/products/kale-lalu-yaha) for 3 months and it has completly changed my skin. I have really sensitive, acne prone, reactionary skin. Most exfoliators, whether physical or chemical, eventually begin to sensitize or irritate my skin.  For example, the Cosrx white head power liquid over-exfoliates my skin if i use it more then once a week (sometimes i have to skip a week). Krave has been the only chemical exfoliant that i could find that has delivered exceptional results and not sensitized my skin.

I took a long break from exfoliants (3 months) because of the damage i had done previously from over exfoliation. i developed a nice thick layer of dead skin and had a lot of reoccurring break outs and blackheads. I don't know about you, but for the first week of using an exfoliator my skin looks smooth and poreless but then it slowly becomes sensitized, bumpy, and rashy/acne (thats when i have to start taking breaks and i never see the results i want. even if i take it slow it ultimately becomes sensitized).

Unlike my previous experiences with chemical exfoliators, I did not see immediate results with Krave. The first three times i used Krave, my skin was still congested and rough. I was really disappointed, but continued using it because (if im going to be honest) you cant return it. I'm so glad that i never had the option to return it because after three weeks of consistent use i  slowly started seeing the roughness of my skin become smoother, my congestion turned into a battlefield of white heads (that took around two months to completly clear out) and the CC's that were on my face for years finally came to the surface.  This has also really helped diminish my pores and fine lines.

I'm so happy with my results. I still have a three or four CC's but i haven't had any new breakouts and the texture of my skin is very smooth. 10/10 would recommend :)

698,AsianBeauty,"[Journal] A bout of cystic acne, and how daily consistency saved my skin","While I was on birth control, nothing, and I repeat, nothing, could make my skin break out. Not the products that made me feel really crappy while it was on my skin. Not a big bag of spicy chips (Chile Limon potato chips, to be specific). Not consumption of a whole jar of kimchi in one day. Not looming ""period"" that wasn't, you know, real period, because I was on birth control after all.

I had been off of birth control for 7 months when the most horrible breakout happened: 3 acne cysts, 1 on the left cheek and 2 on the right cheek. It happened maybe after I ate a whole jar of kimchi in a day (don't judge kimchi is goodness damn it). And overnight, there they were.

During the 7 months between stopping birth control and the 3 acne cysts, my skin didn't get crappy overnight. Just like how birth control helped my skin over time, so did stopping it. The first two months were barely noticeable. Minimal break out close to period, but nothing major. And then the really obvious hormonal acne started to come like clockwork the week before my period - always on my chin. But they weren't *horrible*. They were treatable with the usual benzoyl peroxide and high strength salicylic acid. And it was only the week before my period that I started putting acid on my skin like crazy - salicylic, lactic, at the same time, whatever I had on hand. Then my skin would be flaky, but it would still be no big deal. During these 7 months, I had reverted back to all the old products that I was sure did not make me break out - HABA and The Ordinary. But just reverting back to old products and putting acids on my skin a week per month wasn't enough.

I realized it when the 3 acne cysts all popped up. In a way, they saved my skin.

That's when I realize how terribly clogged my skin was, because I was off birth control. It didn't all of a sudden become ""sensitive"" to new products. It was the oil production causing sebum clogging up my skin that led to these horrible cysts. They probably were looming for a while before I noticed them. So I sat down and thought about how to declog these pores. And I made a resolution to do these 3 things every. single. day.

\- **Oil cleansing**: I couldn't find any literature on how oil cleansers help acne, but anecdotal reports from many people, including those on this subreddit, reassured me enough to try it. I bought a Shu Uemura Ultim8 sublime a while back, but only used it whenever I wore make up that I deemed heavy enough to need an oil cleanser. It was really pleasant to use, but I was just lazy. I now do it every day before putting on night time skin care, without fail. And sure enough, my skin feels so much cleaner without being irritated. Some of the blackheads even loosen over time and fall off with the cleanser!

\- **Exfoliating**: every other day and the week before my period - every day, after oil cleansing with the Shu Uemura, I follow up with the AmorePacific Treatment Enzyme Peel. I've also had this for a long time,  but kind of brushed it aside thinking it was overpriced ineffectiveness when I was only using it twice a week. Now that I use it at least every other day, suddenly my skin seems so much brighter. The exfoliation is gentle and, after getting used to the scent, satisfying. It never dries out my skin.

\- **Salicylic acid**: I know technically this can also fall under exfoliating, but I wanted to give it its own paragraph. I use Paula's 2% BHA, but other 2% BHA products probably would work the same. I actually bought this after the 3 acne cysts popped up, realizing how terribly I needed a daily BHA (I already had her 8% spot treatment, but even that is not enough any more when you have more than 3 pimples all at once...) I now use it twice a day, every day, and it is the product that I remember to use without fail.

I've been doing - if on some day, nothing else - these 3 things consistently, and a period has passed without any pimple popping up on my face. On my jawline, where I don't always apply skin care there as well as my face because I honestly just don't care as much, there are (quite) a few pimples popping up around my period, which means I didn't miraculously have a ""good month"" when my hormones weren't acting out. I didn't have any pimple on my face, because I was diligent, every day, about my skin care.

The 3 acne cysts each took 2 months to go away. Honestly, once they're there, there's nothing short of a cortisone shot that can make them disappear (other than time). But really, they're probably what I needed to tell me to stop being lazy. For some people with good skin (or myself while on birth control), just washing face and putting on the cheapest random drugstore moisturizer would be sufficient to have acne free skin. And then for the rest of us, we just can't.

There's no magic cure for acne. But you may just be able to achieve it, if you take care of your skin every single day. It took me 3 cysts to be reminded of this. I hope it doesn't take you the same amount of pain (ugh).",t3_cev1s8

705,AsianBeauty,"[Discussion] HG Cushion Foundations, Primers, Volumizers and Makeup Fixers?","Hey guys! I want to talk about my favorite type of makeup, complexion! 

I believe Korean Cushions are the best foundations have every tried because a lot of them have given me a super natural look, like my skin but better. I also love how dewy the primers are and I find Volumizers so fun. 

Here are some of my favorite products: 

Moonshot Micro Setting Fit Cushion - I thought I wouldn't like this because I normally like the dewy look, but this cushion has become my HG for summer.  It literally makes me look like I have no makeup on, and it lasts all day. I find the coverage buildable and I just love how it looks like skin on me. Coloring wise, I thought 201 would be too orange on me, but it actually is a bit too fair for me and I might be purchasing 301. 

Pony Effect cushion - Another one of my faves, It makes my skin look so dewy. The shade I got is a bit pale. (I am NW/NC (Yes I have to mix them) 15)  But I love this one. 


Primers : 

I like the dewy look as I mentioned.. however I have only tried two primers. 

VDL Lumilayer Primer - Really like this product, probably won't repurchase. 

Heimeish Artless Glow Base - Not as glowy as I like, but It is a good sunscreen. I use it for when I am not spending a lot of time outdoors. 

Non AB - but I really like Farasali Glass Glow Drops and Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood Flawless Filter as well. 

Volumizer 
Etude House Nymph Glow Aura - Only one I tried, it is good. I find it to be a great dupe for a non AB product, the Kevyn Aucoin Glass Glow Face highlighter. 


Here are some products I want to try that I have on my wishlist on Jolse : 

Cushions: 

moonshot Face Perfection Balm Cushion

CLIO Kill Cover Ampoule Cushion

CLIO Kill Cover Founwear Cushion


Moonflash cushion-  Moonshot

Moonshot Micro Correctfit Cushion

Primer : 

Mamonde Aqua Glow Ball Base 50ml

LANEIGE Glowy Makeup Serum 30ml

721,AsianBeauty,"Houston people! Let's compare notes about the local AB stores, and how do you decide between a relationship with the store, or the lower prices on ebay?","**Ichimaru** has changed up their display again. I've seen one of the Nakeup face cushions, they have the Allie UV sunscreen for 29.99 (about the same as Amazon, but ebay is cheaper). They have some Hada Labo a few dollars more than Amazon prices, an eyelash serum the same marked up price that I've seen on ebay and Amazon.. they have a few kbeauty items. 

*Deals:* After you get 10 points, $20 spend before tax = 1 point, there is a 10% off your next purchase. It seems like there is some kind of membership?

Evidently they have a birthday deal that you get. They seem to have semifrequent posted deals/sales.

&amp;#x200B;

**Japan House** near Seiwa seems to be cheaper generally, with some exceptions than Ichimaru and the selection is different, but a small chuck is the same.

&amp;#x200B;

**Blooming Cosmetics** is... kind of expensive. I feel like the employee that I go to will give me honest opinions and not just try to sell me things. But, these sheet masks that she recommended that I ended up really liking are $28 for 10, Ichimaru has some other ones of that brand on sale $40 for 20 and ebay has it \~$14 for 10. I think the Neogen cleansing pads are $27 or $24 I can't remember. Innisfree items are cheaper elsewhere. The Etude House cat ear hair band is a good price, some of their tools are priced well. Some of the high end kits are sold in sets and the prices aren't too bad I think.. 

Sometimes they get newly released in Korea items-- they got the Laneige Layering cushion fairly early?

I feel like some of their items are fresh, since they get them straight from Korea. If I had to choose between here and Sephora for Laneige, and other items that are the same price at Sephora.. even though I could get that discount at Sephora, I think I'd rather get the Korean version here... Laneige in Korea is a little bit different than the US version. 

The owner remembers me, and she is nice to me. I think that the owner and one of the employees of everyone there will help me find something without just trying to get me to buy something so I appreciate their advice especially since I feel like I haven't figured out how to find the type of advice on here that ends up working for my skin. I get lots of samples. I like O Hui and Phyto vital. They gave me lots of History of Wu spot treatment because I was paranoid about a few spots even though they looked at me like, what spots? You don't need this... But they can be expensive. I'm struggling between continuing to go here and going to ebay. How can I use my loyalty to get lower prices? The owner gave me a discount once on a last-one hair tie. 

*Deals*: After you spend $300 you get $10 back. 

Sometimes when things go on sale, it can be a good price. They had an O Hui cushion buy one get one free (that's 6 packs total for \~$50? can't remember). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Hallyu Cosmetics**: Their prices don't seem too bad. They have smaller brands than Blooming (so it seems to me- the Blooming owner never heard of Goodal when I mentioned the brand). 

I think if you just had surgery on some sort of bone in your face, they can understand (or at least that one girl that one time) that you just had surgery whether or not that was just dental, medically necessary, or cosmetic, they have a good facemask for you. I went looking for eyeliner one day and the advice I got felt like it was coming from a teen who just liked good makeup/skincare and is thinking of something that can do what you're looking for, like a Starbucks barista figuring out how to custom your drink for you when you don't know a clue to what you're doing. 

*Deals*: they seem to have regular sales

&amp;#x200B;

**Aritaum** **(inside H Mart)** feels like Sephora, but they haven't really caught on with new products.

They have the favorite ginger sugar scrub for.. was it the same price as Yesstyle? Or a dollar or two more? Plus you don't need to find $35 to get free shipping or wait a month+ for it... 

*Deals*: their membership feels like Sephora's

Sometimes they have sales and promotions

My skin type is also very sensitive so anything with strong fragrances generally don't work with me. I also bleach and colour my hair. I live on the west coast of Canada (weather is very rainy and mild). I find that I still need to wash my hair daily and spray dry shampoo after in order for my hair to look okay throughout the day. This seems like the only routine that helps my hair look semi-decent.  I've read a couple of other posts regarding similar hair, but I am brand new to this and don't use anything outside of my department store shampoo/conditioner and dry shampoo. I've heard of oil cleansing, apple cider vinegar rinses...I just don't know where to start consuming this information. Do I try items one at a time or switch my routine completely?

If you have the same hair type, could you please share why products you use and what your routine for it is? I'm desperate to try a shampoo / conditioner that can help ease the amount of oil on my scalp, hydrate/soften my hair, reduce my usage of dry shampoo unless I want to skip the shower for a day, and won't flare up any skin sensitivities I have?

753,AsianBeauty,"[Review] A Review After 6 Months of My Current Skincare Routine (Heimish, Benton, Bellalussi, COSRX, Etude House, The Face Shop)","After 6 months of testing out these products, I wanted to give a review of my experience with my current skin care routine. I have normal skin that can have isolated areas of dryness and minimal CC type acne. 

**Oil Cleanser**: Heimish All Clean Balm - This may be one of my HG products. This oil-based cleanser is so through at removing any trace of makeup on my face, even waterproof mascara. It comes with a cute little spatula for scooping out the balm. It never feels like my face has been stripped after washing it off, my skin always feels hydrated and clean.

**Water Based Cleanser**: Benton Honest Cleansing Foam – After using this, I probably won’t buy another foaming cleanser. Even though the product claims to be a non-tightening formula, my skin always feels stretched after washing off this cleanser.  It also has a pretty heavy fragrance, so it may be irritating on sensitive skin. However, this cleanser does create a very rich foam that feels very nice going on to your skin. 

**Toner**: Etude House Wonder Pore Freshner – I have always had pretty large pores between my eyebrows and on the sides of my nose. I have noticed a visible reduction in my pore size since I have started using this toner. It does feel like a very mild toner (I have used some US made toners that have broken me out before) however it feels very hydrating on my skin. I will usually swipe this toner on to my skin with Pyunkang Yul Cotton Pads and then use the cotton pad as a mini sheet mask on areas where I have larger pores.  

**Sheet Masks**: I have honestly been so all over the place with sheet masks, I don’t even know if I’ve purchased one more than once. I even tried a sheet mask subscription service. I’m still on the hunt for a mask that I want to use consistently. I am looking for one that is moisturizing and works to erase and prevent fine lines and wrinkles. 

**Eyecream**: Bellalussi Ultra Repair Snail Peptide Cream – I just loveee snail products, bring on the muscin. I found this eye cream on Amazon out of desperation after that Mizon eye cream sample I was using ran out. I have to say; I am happy with it. It doesn’t sit on top of my skin or feel sticky. I only have to use the lightest layer for each eye, and it absorbs and really feels like it is working. It does claim to reduce dark circles, but I, for one, haven’t noticed that effect. It also comes in a huge tube as far as eye products go. I feel like I may have trouble using it all up before it expires. 

**Essence**: COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence – If I had to pick one AB product that I couldn’t live without, it would be this one. My skin tends to get very dry and flaky during early spring, I don’t know if it is caused by temperature change or seasonal allergies or what. But I get so self-conscious about my face and I can’t wear makeup over the flaky areas, it just don’t work ya’ll. I found this essence right around the time my skin starts to rebel, I already had some flaky-ness going on when I first started using it. I have had zero problems with dryness since then, my skin always soaks this essence up very quickly and feels bouncy and hydrated. On rare days when I am lazy and abbreviate my routine, this still goes on my face. 

**Mostiurizure**: The Face Shot Mango Seed Silk Moisturizing Lotion – I have to admit; I am pretty meh on this one. The scent is not very mango-y which is disappointing to me because I love mango. The formula is decently creamy but also feels watery if that makes sense… Especially after using the COSRX Power Essence, I feel like I can skip this step most days. I would like to find a different moisturizer that is a little thicker in texture and doesn’t have a fragrance.

**Mask**: I am consistently using the COSRX Nourishing Rice Overnight Mask as the last step in my PM routine. This mask does a great job at sealing in all the products in my routine. My skin always feels silky smooth in the morning when I wash it off. It does have a little bit of a sticky texture when it dries down, so if that kind of thing bothers you, you may not like it. 

I hope you guys enjoyed this review of the products that I have been using for my routine. If you’ve used any of them as well, I would love to hear about your personal experiences.",t3_cd9zca

767,AsianBeauty,[Review] of sorts: Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil for removing grease (read: sunscreen) stains from clothes,"I wear a long-sleeved UPF shirt on a daily basis in the summer, and unfortunately the light-colored polyester fabric really loves to soak up the sunscreen on my neck and hands over time. This leaves dark stains as if the clothing is slightly wet, and the stains barely fade when washed normally with laundry detergent or even when scrubbed with Dawn dish soap.

Fortunately, I've found that cleansing oil (I use Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil, as mentioned in the title) makes short work of these stains, with no scrubbing required. Just saturate the stain with the cleansing oil, and wash as normal with the rest of your laundry. This does require a good amount of oil, since the fabric will actively absorb it, so I would definitely recommend using a cheap cleansing oil (the Softymo is the cheapest per mL that I've found) or one that didn't work out for your face.

This trick seems to work on any kind of oil-based stain, including older ones -- I struggled with the sunscreen stains on my UPF shirt for months before trying the cleansing oil! It also works wonderfully on non-polyester fabrics, including my cotton or cotton+poly shirts and pants. So far I can confirm the effectiveness of Softymo on stains from the following:

* Nivea Strong Fit UV Milky Gel (this has been my daily sunscreen since its release; if there's interest in a separate review I'm happy to write one)
* Anessa Perfect UV Sunscreen Skincare Milk
* Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Milk
* Food grease (sizzling K-BBQ is very tasty but also very messy!)

Anyway, I feel like this was a pretty silly ""review"" to write, but hopefully it helps someone. :)

NB: This post is *not* about the yellow/orange stains left by avobenzone on clothes washed in hard water. While my area does have hard water, I avoid avobenzone sunscreens for exactly that reason and have yet to see any orange staining. Though I suppose it wouldn't hurt to try cleansing oil on those...",t3_ccrtw3

&gt;**Avobenzone** is a common irritant and allergen, so it tends to be unsuitable for sensitive skin, and you’re left with inorganic sunscreens only.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you’re elsewhere in the world, the newer UVA1 filters aren’t particularly irritating or allergenic.  
&gt;  
&gt;A few other organic sunscreens also tend to cause allergic and irritant reactions: **octocrylene, oxybenzone, avobenzone, PABA, Padimate O and enzacamene.**

**Fragrant oils/extracts:** orange peel essential oil, lavender essential oil

**Potentially problematic things:** Titanium Dioxide alone may not be ideal for some, as it doesn't cover as much of the UV spectrum as other sunscreen agents, particularly UVA.

**Other Info:** 30 Months unopened, 12 months opened, Innisfree suggests writing down the date you opened it/got it on the back of the bottle, due to the lack of more stronger preservatives.

**Potentially problematic ingredients:** **Agar** is used here, possibly as a thickener, but apparently some people break out from algae/seaweed. But it's used in a very small amount. **Royal jelly** does not have substantial studies backing its usefulness in skincare, it may also be an irritant for some (PC). It contains a lot of **ethanol**, the drying alcohol, for those of you who want to avoid it. Alcohol is usually used as a solvent for other ingredients and elegant fast drying effects/enhancing skin penetration.

**Good Things:**

\- Awesome **modern, broad-spectrum** sunscreen filters *(not that others are BAD, the overall formula matters, but for sensitive skinned folks looking for less-irritating chemical filters, the new ones are of interest)*

\- **Hyaluronic acid** &amp; some other things for humectants

\- **Xylitol** provide prebiotic benefits

[**Here's a great breakdown of chemical vs physical sunscreens by Labmuffin**](https://labmuffin.com/chemical-vs-physical-sunscreens-the-science-with-video/)

&amp;#x200B;

**Why are there so many recent products with a lot of essential oils?**

I personally think it's because **essential oils** get a pass rating of ""**1**"" in EWG (Environmental Working Group) but **fragrance** gets an ""**8**"". This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.

There are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.

Some companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.

&amp;#x200B;

**What about preservatives?**

There's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of ""chemicals"", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.

Parabens are actually quite ""natural"" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.

&amp;#x200B;

**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.

**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.

&amp;#x200B;

Antioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.

For your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy &amp; elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**

[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) &amp; How using ""natural"" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.

*P.S. I don't know if I'm going to make any more of these lists bc there isn't that much interest in these sorts of things anyway, generally.*

775,AsianBeauty,SKIPCARE but I stopped using moisturizer?,"I used to use the Nature Republic Aqua moisturizer for combination skin (the green one) and it did the job pretty well, it did moisturize my skin without the excess grease. But for some reason since I started using it, my skin became bumpy and textured. I use the cetaphil gentle cleanser (used since I was 13) with it and my trusty Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner, so it could only mean that it's the one causing my skin to get bumpy. I stopped using it for about 5 days now and my skin became smoother. I ran out of the gentle skin cleanser so I use a foam cleanser now but still use the Pyunkang Yul toner. I use the It's Skin Power Effector VC(?), the yellow one at night after my toner and my routine is done. I don't feel dry, and I haven't had any adverse reaction yet. I know that moisturizer is essential but **is the Pyunkang Yul toner enough for hydrating my skin?** I don't feel like using the moisturizer again or try any new products for fear of breaking out or getting bumpy skin.

P.S. I exfoliate in the morning using the Nivea Baby cream or something like that by massaging it for a minute on my face and then wiping it with a wet towel. I wash with clean water then leave it like that the rest of the day and i never felt dry or greasy - my skin feels comfortable. I don't wash my skin with cleanser in the morning.

Doing skin care for a long time, I feel like I may be doing something wrong by not sticking to the 'essentials,' but I want to scrape off my preconceived notions and believe in my routine since it's working well for me. **I want to know if any of you tried this sort of 'breaking the rules' routine and how it worked for you.**",t3_ccr6d8

777,AsianBeauty,Reviews of All the AB Products/Brands I Have Tried,"My skin type: oily, semi acne-prone, sensitive to scarring 

I have tried a lot of AB products since my skin started to have cc's, acne, scars, sign of dullness (shout out to my P.E teacher for all the time my class had to run in the sun for 45 minutes and my dumbass thinking sunscreen was a waste of time) 

// all of these reviews are my personal opinions and please remember that products work differently for everyone. I am not a professor of skin care ingredients, I just want to share my own experience of products I used (long post) //

[ **COSRX**]

• **AHA WHITEHEAD LIQUID**: I have seen so much hype for this products, and I looked forward to this product getting rid of my whiteheads or smoothing my skin with its AHA. It did nothing for me, I kept trying to use it hoping something would happen but I saw no improvement. I'd leave it on my skin for 3 hours after school everyday, it just felt like a left  a watery lotion layer on my skin and that is it. 

• **BHA BLACKHEAD LIQUID**: Again, same hype I saw, same expectation I had, same experience. If there's anything I can give credit for,  I'd say it absorbs well/fast though I saw no results using it. My blackheads on the nose weren't improved, it felt like an unnecessary skin care step for me. 

• **Rice Sleeping Mask**: I absolutely loved it! Though I stopped using it since my skin grew other concerns than dullness. This sleeping mark absorbs fast and left my skin hydrated, but it got a bit oily after a while. For a product you can find under $14,  this product does what it promises. Just don't expect it to leave your skin dewy, instant bright etc. 

• **AC COLLECTION SPOT TREATMENT**: HG!!!! I CAN'T SHOW ENOUGH LOVE FOR THIS. I purchased it when I was stressed with exams, got random pimples on my cheeks every now and then and of course, the scars of past acnes. The product lasts for a long time and doesn't irritate my skin. It actually helps my acnes to dry up within 3-5 days and the acnes tend to leave no scars. 

• **ACNE PIMPLE MASTER PATCH**: I can't say much about it except that it works. Though it only works for acnes that already show heads, I wouldn't consider it a HG. It didn't (magically) smoothen then calm the acne spot as it was advertised. 

• **SNAIL 96 MUCCIN POWER ESSENCE**: I knew this product got a lot of love on this sub Reddit but I couldn't bring myself to love it. It felt sticky, wouldn't absorb at all which made it harder for me to apply the left of my skin care routine. I gave up on it after 2 week of use. 

[ **LANEIGE ]

• **WATER SLEEPING MASK**:  HG! I am on my 4th bottle right now. It's soooo soothing and hydrating. It absorbs into my skin the moment I pat, leaving my skin matte. It's easily found on Amazon or eBay for &lt;$18. It does have fragrance but I'm not bothered by it, it smells fresh actually. My skin is always brightened in the morning and soft after using this sleeping mask. 

[ **INNISFREE ]

• **TANGERINE VITA C CREAM**:  I recently grew a huge obsession with vitamin C. I know this product isn't popular, most don't even know it existed. And honesty, most don't know about it because IT ABSOLUTELY DID NOTHING. Citrus smell, gel-like texture, absorbs nicely, but did absolutely nothing besides drying my skin after 30 mins of application

• **MINERAL OIL FREE CUSHION**: I love it! It has a mint-y feel after you apply it, keep the oil under control for &lt;3 hours. 

• **PORE WHITENING SLEEPING MASK**: Like I said, I was obsessed with Vitamin C. This sleeping mask comes in a huge bottle (100mL), I'm currently still using it. It absorbs well only if you spend 60 seconds patting it, though it does brighten my scars and skin tone, doesn't cause acne or irritation. 

• **PORE WHITENING SERUM**: The texture of this serum was exactly like its sleeping mask. I hated it. I foam up on my skin, made it impossible to apply the next product without leaving a mess. 

• **JEJU ORGANICE GREEN TEA SEED SERUM** : I don't hate it or nor love it. I only use it once in a while when I'm bored to be frank. It doesn't really help much with anything, maybe a little bit of hydration? I find it to stay on the skin rather than absorbing in. I expected it to soothe my redness after I went out in the sun, but again, like I said, it didn't do much. 

[ **SKIN&amp;LAB**]

• **RED SERUM**:  I was intrigued by the name, looked up the info and found the product to contain many new ingredients and source of Vitamin C. It offered to brighten up your skin, anti-aging,  and moisturize. It has kind of a weird scent, very light,  absorbs easily and so far I see my skin getting that glow using it without any acnes or irritation. 

[ **ETUDE HOUSE** ] 

• **TONING WHITE C TONE UP CREAM**:  Gel-like texture, keeps my oil under control better than most tone up creams I have used. It doesn't really moisturize well though it does tone up the skin, doesn't cause acne. The toneup doesn't really has the glow effect I expect but it's a fine product. I'll use it for longer to see if it brightens up skin tone overall other than just toning up. 

• **TONING WHITE C SLEEPING MASK**:  The texture is super familiar with the Innisfree Pore Whitening Sleeping Mask. Absorbs nicely, has a fresh lemon smell. My face doesn't feel oily after using it, I sort of love it. It's light and perfect for the summer use. 

• **MY LASH SERUM**:  I have only started using it for 2 weeks but I have noticed my lashes getting curlier and my lower lashes are a tad longer. Kind of shocked(?). It works so well for a product under $5

• **VITA C TALK GEL CREAM**:  Lightweight, but definitely doesn't do anything besides hydrating. It's not bad, but when I bought a Vitamin C product I really expect it to brighten my skin rather than just hydrating. 

•**ETUDE HOUSE MOISTFUL COLLAGEN CREAM**:  My skin is responsive to it, it leaves my skin moisturized the second it's tapped. A tiny bit of product is enough to cover my face. An amazing moisturizer for such a price imo. Isn't outstanding but if you're just looking for an affordable product to moisturize, this is it

[**TONY MOLY*"" ]

• **Vita 12 Synergy Cream**: Absolutely hate it. It has a yellow-ish color and smells awful. It gave me bad break-out and I couldn't find myself wanting to touch that product again after a week of use. 

• **GREEN VITA C SPARKLING SERUM**: I think this is the only product I have found of Tony Moly that doesn't contain unbearable fragrance. My skin likes it, not necessarily love it. Does it absorb? Yes. Does it reduce acne scar appearance? Yes. But it feels oily, not extremely but I couldn't stand it when my face feels like an oily pan. 

[ **GLOW RECIPE** ]

• **WATERMELON SLEEPING MASK**: OMG GUYS I CAN'T LOVE THIS ENOUGH! Put aside the fact that you have to mix it every 2 nights so the texture isn't separated, it gives me such a good glow. I have felt in love with this and thought this was the only good product worth spending $45 for. It takes care of my acnes scar, brighten my skin, feel amazing on my skin. Definitely helped with my most concerns: acne and dullness

• **WATERMELON PINK JUICE MOISTURIZER**: I wanted to love it, I really did but the texture of this moisturizer never absorbed on my skin. It even made my skin oilier. Such huge disappointment. 

• **SWEET CHEF BEET + VITAMIN A SERUM**:  I found this art Target,  was intrigued since Glow Recipe made this. It does leave me a glowy look after the first use but it's so hard to take the product to use that I couldn't be bothered to continue using it. If they ever make this product easier to come out I'll definitely repurchase


• **SWEET CHEF KALE + VITAMIN B SERUM**: It's meant for dry skin, I bought it out of curiousity though of course my skin hated it. Couldn't absorb, texture is too thick for a serum. 

• **SWEET CHEF GINGER + VITAMIN C SERUM**: The only product my skin lives for out of three. Not an ordinary Vitamin C Serum but it's cheap and easy to find for me, it does what vitamin C suppose to do. My skin tone is so responsive to it! 

[ **ROHTO** ]

**MELANO CC ESSENCE SPOT TREATMENT**: I used it a couple times but stopped when I had too much Vitamin C related skin care. I surprisingly reduced my acne appearance after the first use I was shook honestly. But I didn't like the idea of using tube personally, it just felt tiring squeezing it on my finger for but. I knew it help the product to not be oxidized but definitely not my cup of tea. The product overall was amazing. 

[ **NEOGEN**] 

**VITAMIN C SERUM**: It contains 22% of vitamin C + Niacinamide so I was afraid it would be too irritating. The result was opposite of what I expected, HG! Absorbs easily with a couple pats, doesn't have fragrance and my skin has never been more pleased. It faded my super old acne scars that my other products couldn't. I really recommend everyone to give it a look if you're looking for a new Vitamin C serum. 

[ **KLAIRS** ]

• **FRESHLY JUICED VITAMIN E MASK**:  The texture is weird, and really hard to apply imo. It also contains cica kind of smell. I tried to use it at the end of my routine but the texture if its just ended up make my serums a mess (it foamed up) 

• **FRESHLY JUICED VITAMIN C**:  Contains only 5% vitamin C. It's gentle but not my cup of tea. I think it's good for sensitive skin people but for me, I didn't see any result using it. The white glass of this product gave me anxiety as well as it made the product oxidize easier.",t3_ccbm0y

Environment: humid all year round in Malaysia. 

WNR - would not repurchase

MRP - might repurchase

HG - holy grail

*= broke out my sensitive skin but did show some effects, so it might work for you

*pH 5.5 Relief Toner*

WNR - This is a HG for many people, its sad it couldnt make it to my HG list. This toner doesn’t really hydrate my dry skin, it feels oily and it pills on top of my skin instead of hydrating. I would rather go back to my Hada Labo Light toner to properly hydrate my skin. 

*10 Free Moist Emulsion* 

MRP - I love how the emulsion doesn’t pills on my skin compared to other emulsions normally does on me. Absorbs well, actually pretty moisturizing on its own. Doesn’t leave any irritation on me, which is a bonus. 

*2x Barrier Intensive Cream*

MRP - I have been looking for a decent moisturiser that won’t cause any breakouts on my sensitive acne prone skin and I think I finally found it. I don’t feel it moisturize my face better than my TO squalane oil, however I would consider repurchasing this in case I can’t get my hands on my squalane oil any time soon. 

*5 Panthensoside Cica Balm*

MRP - This cica balm is a HG for some people too, saying it helped their skin tremendously. I bought this balm expecting it to perform like it claim, to reduce redness and shrink acne. I have been using this for several weeks, but I don’t see any improvements on my redness nor my acne. Yes, this balm has a soothing effect but it doesn’t really improve anything else besides just soothing the skin. Bonus to this for not causing me any breakouts. 


*Pros* : 
- doesn’t cause any breakouts 
- suitable for sensitive skin 
- does soothe the skin

*Cons*: 
- doesn’t help improve redness or acne
- not very hydrating for dehydrated skin",t3_ccd1it

&amp;#x200B;

As we all know, sunscreen is the most essential step in our skincare routine.

I'm constantly buying and trying new sunscreens because I have nothing better to do with my time.

Skin Type: Combination (Oily T-Zone, normal everywhere else) / Acne-prone

&amp;#x200B;

\- **A'pieu Power Block Aqua Sun Gel SPF 50+ PA++++**

This is so good, it has a semi-matte finish, no white-cast and feels very hydrating.

Easy to spread, easy to re-apply, kept my t-zone less oily, what more could you want? Oh and it's 8$ for 50ml.

*Filters*: **Homosalate**, **Avobenzone**, **Tinosorb S**, **Octocrylene**

&amp;#x200B;

\- **Missha Aqua Sun Gel SPF 50+ PA++++**

Very similar in texture to the A'pieu one, but I think this one might've clogged my pores. Still used it up because it was also really really good. This one also has a minor mattifying effect. It also costs \~8$ for 50ml.

*Filters:* **Homosalate**, **Avobenzone**, **Tinosorb S**, **Octocrylene**

&amp;#x200B;

\- **Canmake Mermaid Skin UV Gel SPF SPF 50+ PA++++**

This one is very popular in this sub, everyone here praises it and loves it. I'm not here to dethrone it, everything that's been said about this one is true; fragrance-free, white-cast free, alcohol free, all the bad things. It spreads beautifully, it makes your skin glow. BUT, it's expensive. 12.50$ for 40ml is too much for me.

*Filters:* **Octinoxate, Uvinul A Plus, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Tinosorb S**

&amp;#x200B;

\- **Biore Aqua Rich UV Essence 2019 SPF 50+ PA++++**

The cult-favorite sunscreen, the holy grail, the magical sunscreen that solves all of your problems.

Nope.

We've all heard of this sunscreen, we've all tried it or have wanted to try it, well I'd tell you, skip the 2019 one. I have previously tried the 2017 formulation and it was great, it didn't feel like anything, absorbed easily, just overall perfect. But this one, oh honey, no. They went somewhere wrong with the formula because this one leaves a disgusting sticky residue on my skin and aggravates my oil production. The only positive thing about this sunscreen is that it makes my skin glow.

If you have oily skin, do not get this. Maybe it works for dry/normal skinned folks, but my oily friends - you will regret purchasing this one.

*Filters:* **Octinoxate, Tinosorb S, Uvinal A Plus**

&amp;#x200B;

\- **Balea Sundance Sensitiv Sonnenfluid SPF 50**

The only european sunscreen in this review. It has an amazing texture, really hydrating, no bad ingredients, but, it certainly does have a white-cast that doesn't fade. I use this as a body sunscreen.

*Filters:* **Uvinal A Plus, Titanium Dioxide (Nano), Ensulizole**

&amp;#x200B;

\- **Innisfree Triple Care SPF 50+ PA++++**

The worst white-cast I've ever experienced, absolutely disgusting smell and made people think I had some disease because it made me that pale. Do not get this.

782,AsianBeauty,Sun sticks or sun cushion? Which do you prefer and why?,"I'm debating how I should go about reapplying sunscreen. There are some pros and cons that I've gathered so far.

Sun sticks:

Pro - convenient and easy to wipe off bacteria with alcohol wipe

Con - may be harder to get around crevices, like the nose and eye area. Weirder to apply a deodorant-like stick onto your face in public (say on a train or bus)


Sun cushions: so I plan on not refilling a sponge for hygienic reasons and also to avoid the sun screen going bad (you risk exposing it to air more frequently after pouring it into a cushion, i.e. liquid sunscreen wasn't formulated to last in this condition/outside the tube). I plan on just keeping an empty cushion case with the blender and just carry around the tube of sunscreen then apply as needed. This also saves on product waste since I won't be soaking a sponge with the sunscreen. 

Pros - convenient, will have a mirror on the go, will be able to reach crevices on the face like the eye and nose. 

Cons - sponges tend to accumulate bacteria and grime more often which is what's steering me away from using this method.",t3_cce3us

788,AsianBeauty,Korean Vacation Haul + Review~,"I went on a trip to Korea a few weeks ago and was meaning to review these products sooner, but ended up taking a vacation to Thailand too! So I'll throw in a review for the few products I bought there too.

Background: I have very fair, combo/dry skin, live in a humid climate, and have lots of hyperpigmentation, scarring, and hormonal acne.

**Peripera Ink Skin Tint in #1 Ivory - 5/5**

I absolutely love this foundation, it's a really fair price, about 9000 won and it's perfect for the light days where I want very little coverage. Which is pretty much everyday...I'm comfortable with my skin for the most part, and I love how it shows my summer freckles. The shade range is awful, but it's so light that it almost doesn't matter. The shade is almost too light for me right now, but I suspect in the winter it will be a dead on match. When I don't want to use my trusty laneige cushion, this is what I have been reaching for to feel a little more put together.

&amp;#x200B;

**3CE Heart Pot Lip in #Woody Rose - 4.5/5**

I went into Stylenanda expecting not to get anything, but this caught my attention. It's a travel sized lip pot with a little mirror and everything and it's got the cutest packaging. If I recall correctly it was about 6000 won, so not too expensive for 3CE. And let me tell you, I love the colour so much. It's the most perfect, disney princess, rosebud, but still natural look. This is what I wear when I want to look natural, but want that soft red to contrast with my features. The reason it's not a full 5 stars is that it's not particularly long wearing, but I still love it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Innisfree my blush in #5 - 5/5**

I'm not going to lie, I got this as a free gift for the obscene amount of money I spent at innisfree buying backups of my HG moisturizer, the innisfree green tea seed cream. I would have never picked this shade out, but it's my favorite thing I got. It's a beautiful, rosy brown that is the exact shade that my skin blushes. It genuinely looks like I was just caught in the sun, and it lasts very well, I'm so glad that I got it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Innisfree Smart Drawing Blusher in 01 - 4/5**

I had super high expectations for this blush, it came highly recommended and was even compared to the Glossier cloud paints (non-ab), one of my favorite cream blushes. This is really good! I love the scent, the color is a bit light, but still really natural and pretty. But my main issue is the applicator, like the cloud paints, I always feel like I'm wasting product and ultimately, money. I do like it though, and would like to try some different colors because the formula is super nice and cooling.

&amp;#x200B;

**VT Cosmetics BT21 Lipstick in 01 (Shooky) - 5/5**

Let me be honest, I only bought this because I stan BTS. Yoongi, the man who created shooky, isn't even my bias (though I do adore him), but I was pleasantly surprised by this lipstick. The formula is good, nothing particularly special, it's a nice, creamy lipstick with a satin matte finish. But what surprised me was the beautiful colour of this lipstick. It's a perfect, rosy browny nude that can go with literally any look I wear. It's not too cool, it's not too warm, it just makes my lips look soft and plush and not unlike a disney princess'. It's my new go to shade and I love it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Peripera ASMR Lip Balm in #1 - 2/5**

I've been searching for the perfect baby pink lipstick, one that would be sweet and nice, without pulling too Barbie dreamhouse on me. I picked this up with high hopes, but unfortunately it's not quite the right shade on me. I prefer more muted tones, and it's just a hair too bright. The formula isn't awesome, it's a bit gloopy, and I don't like that I can't twist down. I think I'm going to donate it to a friend because it's just not doing it for me.

&amp;#x200B;

**Peripera Airy Ink Velvet in 05 Genius Rosy Pink - 4.5/5**

I do have another peripera ink tint in the original formula, and I love it! But I saw this on sale at olive young and I think I like this one even more. It's a gorgeous pink, with a finish that makes your lips look pillowy. But I don't like it best on it's own. I think that it works better as a sort of ""inner lip"" finisher or blotted.  It lasts pretty well, and I really like it. The .5 is docked because I wish it was just a bit softer.

&amp;#x200B;

**Peripera Sugar Twinkle Liquid Eyeshadow in #12 - 5/5**

I bought this in hopes that it would satisfy my want for the Stila liquid shadows, and boy did this do the job. It is the most beautiful sparkle, that can be built up, or blended out in a sheer wash of sparkle that just catches the light. I can't speak to all the shades, but I love this so much.

&amp;#x200B;

\~Bonus Thai Products\~

**4u2 Heart Me Cream Blush in Sweet as You - 3/5**

To be honest, not my favorite cream blush formula. The color is amazing, but it's too matte for my tastes. I want to play around with it more to see if I can try applying it with a brush or sponge to see if I can make it work for me. It's got such cute packaging and is a wonderful brown/red.

&amp;#x200B;

**4u2 Hello Kitty Mousse Tint in Peach- 3/5**

I bought this because of packaging and the pretty peach color. But the formula is not a mousse, it's just a liquid lipstick and it doesn't particularly smell good. I'm not so into liquid lipstick anymore, and this formula isn't quite what I look for anymore. I'm going to play around with different gloss combos and pairing it with other lipsticks that I like, but if I don't end up liking it, I'll give it to a friend.

791,AsianBeauty,[Review] SOS: Save Our Skin – Mediheal P.D.F. AC- Defense Nude Gel Mask,"[This mask yall.](https://www.masksheets.com/p-d-f-ac-defense-nude-gel-mask-g.html)

&amp;#x200B;

[Mediheal P.D.F. A.C.–Defense Hydro Nude Gel Mask. It's a mouthful, and I don't know what any of those acronyms mean.](https://i.redd.it/cte9of4nrs931.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

So when I first opened this I was caught a little off guard, because I'd bought it without knowing that it was a gel mask. The plastic guard and the mask itself are both clear so I literally thought I'd bought a defective one that was missing its mask lol.

When I saw this in the store, I just read the words ""pore refining/sebum control"" and instantly I was SOLD. Usually I shouldn't believe everything on the packaging but I guess I lucked out because it did everything it claimed it would do and more.

&amp;#x200B;

I paid 4000 won at Olive Young, and for the quality of this thing, it's a damn steal. Of course, if I wanted to make this a regular and use it every week, it'd add up but STILL. Compared to some of those pricy ampoule masks out there, it's the next best thing.

&amp;#x200B;

As you might have guessed, I have intensely oily skin, and because my skin thinks it's such a great idea to pump out enough sebum to grease a pan, I also have intensely big pores, and my past acne scarring makes some of them look like they're permanently open, like a pothole in my face.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd been pretty lazy in terms of skincare and decided that today would be the ""revamp day."" I went all out. I wish I had the diligence to do this every day lol.

Here is what I used besides the mask, and what probably helped make sure it worked.

1. Oil Cleanse: Erno Laszlo Phelityl Oil
2. La Roche Posay Effaclar Gel Cleanser for Oily Skin
3. Mario Badescu Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs, and Rosewater
4. Mediheal P.D.F. A.C.– Defense Hydro Nude Gel Mask
5. TheFaceShop Dr. Belmeur Cica Peptite Ampoule

The mask comes in two parts, for the top and bottom half of the face. This makes customizing the size to different face shapes easier and because it's a gel, it sticks to your face so well, but it does not leave a sticky residue.

I really should've taken a before/after photo but I didn't expect this mask to show results so immediately – I thought it was one of those that I had to use consistently to start seeing differences but my pores looked visibly tightened, and my face looked more plump. Most of all, my skin looked *clean.* Usually when I start putting face products after washing my face, I feel as if some of the products that I use don't absorb all the way and leave my pores looking just as big as before washing. But my face looked satisfyingly clear.

I do admit I left it on for longer than advised, but by the time I went to take it off, my skin had basically sucked the moisture out of the gel sheet.

Although I am one to finish my skin routine AT the sheet mask on the days I use them, the juice from the gel mask had absorbed so freakin well that I thought I'd put an extra step that would provide a good barrier for my skin as I went to bed.

&amp;#x200B;

This mask is one of those I'd recommend to use before going out, a date, an important event, or on days you just want to look good because of how supple it leaves the skin, it'd be a good primer for base makeup.

**Overall:**

* Mask is a two gel sheets that can fit on any face
* The gel nature of the sheet makes the skin really absorb the mask serum
* Does not leave the face with excess serum on the face, pores noticeably tighter
* Sebum-controlling component make this mask a good primer before base makeup, can be a daytime mask acting as a foundation primer that can also protect skin from pollution, dust, etc.
* Face should be especially well-cleansed before using mask to ensure getting the most out of it.
* Mask serum is lighter than how it feels on the hands – highly buildable on top, whether it be ampoules or creams.
* Would recommend storing in fridge before use. Face feels plumper and it just feels good to have your face suck on a cold, slimy, gel sheet.
* Would take caution when taking the plastic guard off the mask – the mask was pretty slippery when it came out it was a bit difficult to separate the plastic layer from the gel layer. The sheet for the upper face has TWO plastic guards on each side... that confused me a little bit,",t3_cc65ny

For reference here’s my skin a day apart when I first used it. (The first photo is after, the second photo is before)  You can really see how much it calmed down my redness. (possibly mild rosacea). Of course do patch test because what works for me might not work for you. 


http://imgur.com/a/wE6ajeu


Texture: 💧 

This baby has the texture of water, and you can layer with without a problem. If you get a little too zealous like I was, it can get sticky, but it wasn’t anything too unbearable. The finish of this is super pretty too it dries down to a smooth satin glow without looking oily. If you’re someone who doesn’t like to put a lot of skincare on in the AM I feel like this would work really well under makeup. 

Scent: 💐

Usually all my skincare is fragrance free and essential oil free so I don’t really get to enjoy the scent of products. I either get bland boring lotion or chemicals. Neither an attractive scent. I’m also that fun person who can smell you wearing your Victoria Secret perfume a mile away— and yes I will get a headache from it. So I need something non offensive. This straight up smells like an apple pie. I had to double check the ingredients to make sure they didn’t had fragrance. It smells SO good. I had to stop myself from wanting to eat it a few times. I looked like a crazy person sniffing my hands after applying it because it smelled so good.

Effects: 🌿

This instantly calmed down all my redness in a matter of minutes. When my skin is at its most sensitive I notice just how much cooler and less red my face looks. My overall skin looks much healthier, and my skin looks and feels softer.

Overall Thoughts: 💭 

Not to be overdramatic, but I would die for this. I’ve been into AB for three years, and I can say truly without a doubt this is THE only product that hasn’t irritated my skin. I’m dying to try the I’M From essence, but unless that beats this one the Missha Essence is my HG. I really wished I had mugwort essence when I first started AB three years ago.",t3_cc0cbh

796,AsianBeauty,[Review] Rohto Skin Aqua UV Moisture Milk.. Possible Holy Grail,"For a while I have been on a search for sunscreens that don’t have whitecast and are also waterproof (I sweat easily and it’d be a waste to sweat off sun protection 10 mins after going outside) and saw a lot of positive feedback for this sunscreen. I am also caramel skinned so having little to no whitecast is important to me, no one wants to look pasty.

I had previously bought a sunscreen by Neutrogena that was SPF 100+ and was super disappointed, in store the whitecast seemed minimal but applied it was terrible, thats when I realized I needed to investigate into better sunscreen and decided to try an AB brand. I decided on this one because it was waterproof as well which is very important to me.

I have been using it about a week and I really love it!! It is thin and not pasty like American sunscreens, glides on very easily. It is a little oily if you use a lot but rubbed into skin is no different than a good moisurizer, definitely gives you some glow as opposed to washing you out. It has no whitecast when rubbed in so it is definitely suitable for brown skin and maybe even darker. I have also used it before working out outside and when sweating you can see a little whitecast but wiped away is almost nothing. It is also 100% better than what has happened to me when using an American sunscreen.

I’m really liking it and would definitely rebuy. I got mine off of ebay for about 15, it is the newest 2019 edition of this sunscreen. The only negative is the bottle is small for price but to me definitely worth it for how good it is and pretty affordable for the benefit. I also really like that the applicator is small, I just draw lines on my face with the bottle and rub it in as opposed to squirting some on your hands like lotion and applying it that way like I was doing before. 

If you are tan/darker skinned and looking for waterproof sunscreen or no whitecast I definitely recommend trying it.",t3_cc07yi

802,AsianBeauty,[Guide] A Really short introduction to Asian Beauty for newbies.,"## What's Asian Beauty (AB)? 

Cosmetics from Asia. Simple as that. 

## Will Asian cosmetics be better for my skin? 

That depends on your needs and concerns. The industry is somewhat different, but the products themselves aren't exactly groundbreaking or special compared to western options. Just think of it as widening your shopping options.

## What's my skin type? How do I find it? Why does it matter?

Generally you want to assess your skin type when it's completely bare. Wash with water, and then try to see how it responds. 

* **Oily** - Your skin produces sebum fairly quickly, enough for it to get visible in a short time. 
* **Dry** - Your skin products little to no sebum, or takes too long to do so, thus making your face feel dry. Often sensitive.  
* **Combination** - Only your nose and forehead (T-Zone) gets oily.
* **Normal** - Your skin feels fine as it is. 

Skin types aren't permanent, it depends on other aspects such as the state of your hormones or even the climate you reside in. Some people see shifts in their skin based on weather or even indoor temperatures. 

Knowing your skin type is important because you want to build a skincare routine around it. If your routine doesn't fit you, then you're likely to cause more problems to yourself. 

## What kind of products are out there? 

1. **Cleanser** - To clean your face with. There are generally two types of cleansers that are mentioned: Surfactant based (Example: Soap) and Oil based (Oils are good at breaking down things, hence why it's used as a cleanser). 
2. **Toner / Skin / Lotion** - A light watery product with the goal to hydrate your skin. 
3. **Essence / Serum / Ampoule** - Products with the goal of providing a higher concentration of a specific ingredient. 
4. **Moisturizing Cream / Moisturizing Gel / Emulsion** - Moisturizers
5. **Sunscreen** - To protect from the sun. SPF refers to UVB protection. PA/PPD refers to UVA protection.  
6. **Sleeping Masks / Occlusives** - Product with the goal of trapping moisture underneath it. 
7. **Wash Off Masks / Sheet Masks** 

There are other product types, but for the sake of clarity and being a beginner guide it's best to just have these in mind. 

### Do I need to use all of these products? 

No. Routines are individual and personal. Do what's comfortable for you. 

As an example here are some (not all) reasons why you may not need certain products: 

* Some oily skinned people may not want moisturizers at all and use only a Toner / Skin / Lotion. 
* Essence / Serum / Ampoule aren't the only product types with a concentration of an ingredient. You can find plenty of ingredient focus moisturizers or even toners. 
* Some people tend to feel more dryer with a cleanser, and simply washing their face with water. 

### What's the most core routine? 

1. Cleanser
2. Moisturizer 
3. Sunscreen 

### Do these products have to be used in a specific order? 

No. Go lightest to heaviest as a general guide. Main exceptions are: 

* **Sunscreen**: Should always be last in the morning.  
* **Occlusives / Sleeping Masks**: Should be last at night. 

### Are there products more important than others? 

This is a pretty personal question. While some may immediately respond 'sunscreen', there may be those who lead a life with little to no sun exposure: Working late night shifts, living somewhere where the sun isn't up much, etc. What's most important depends entirely on your skin and your needs. 

## Is there anything else I need to know? 

Naturally, like many other things, there is a lot more information than presented. But trying to consume it all as a newbie will do you no good and only complicate things for absolutely no reason. Some things are more advanced with reason, and it would be a bit risky to do anything with the more advanced steps without even understanding the basics.",t3_cbsl4b

I just received my order of the Holika Holika Make up sun cream 60 ML (PA+++ SPF 50+). Here is my review:  
\- **Texture : 10/10 :** It's not too thick or too runny, its texture is a bit similar to the Skin Aqua Tone up UV Essence / A'pieu Madecassoside Sun Cream   
\- **Sun protection :** Physical filter (Zinc Oxide, info from CosDNA.com, although I'm not sure what % ), good for sensitive skin. I have been wearing it for 4 hours and so far no allergy, no burns  
\- **SMELL : 0/10 .** The smell is floral and nice, and I have no problem with a little fragrance from time to time, but the smell LINGERS AFTER 4 HOURS OF WEAR JUST LIKE A PERSISTENT EX.  It made my nose really sensitive and stuffed, and I had to wipe off the sunscreen patch in front of my nose.  


If you do not want a stuffed nose, or you simply hate fragrance in your cosmetics, AVOID THIS PRODUCT ASAP.

819,AsianBeauty,[Review] Pigeon UV Baby Milk Waterproof SPF 50+ PA++++,"&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/vilsg9tn2e931.jpg

Haven't seen a review for this sunscreen yet so thought I'd post! This sunscreen uses physical filters only (zinc &amp; titanium dioxide), is unscented, no alcohol, no parabens. See [ingredients](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/pigeon-uv-baby-milk-waterproof-spf50/) at Ratzilla.

I've used this sunscreen consistently \~ 2 weeks now, so got a pretty good feel for it. I've used almost exclusively Japanese sunscreen since 2016, but recently with my raging hormones, I wanted to be safe and use products for sensitive skin. Also curious about Japanese physical sunscreen and wondered if they're better than my horrible experience with the Cerave one (which surprised me as their other skincare products minus sunscreen are solid). Well, surprisingly (or I guess not, considering the Japanese skincare market is brutal), it's much, much better.

**Application**: applies nicely without that really sticky feel of physical sunscreen (but then, my only reference is Cerave so maybe you won't be as pleasantly surprised as me). It **DOES** leave a white cast on my skin (Asian, about NC20-NC25), but disappears nicely after \~10 mins or so (works for me, that's when I start driving and start to put on my foundation - please don't report me to highway patrol :( ). **Unscented**.

**Feel**: throughout the day, it is not greasy, which is a plus for my combo skin. I've tried to experiment with layering just a moisturizing toner (Japanese lotion) beneath it, and by the time I put on my matte foundation, my skin feels pretty matte, bordering dry. If I use a moisturizing toner, then light emulsion, then the Pigeon and matte foundation, it's perfect. I'd say if you have oily skin but don't use foundation, or use a dewy foundation, you may be able to get away with just a moisturizing toner. If you have dry skin, this one may be a tough sell - you'll probably have to layer quite a bit of hydration, as this sunscreen adds none.

**Effectiveness**: well, I've worn it exclusively for two weeks and within this time frame, my skin has gotten brighter (from other products - not the sunscreen, but that means it does what it claims to do). So I guess it works. It is truly waterproof - even after a 10 hr work day, when I come back and splash water on my face, it is still there and I can see the round water droplets roll down my face nicely - so yay, waterproof as it claims. I do use an oil cleanser on days I use it, as I'm doubtful just my Glossier jelly cleanser can get this baby off.

**Overall:** It's not exciting, but it gets the job done. Solid option for those with sensitive skin and want to try a physical sunscreen. It won't be as elegant as your chemical ones, but pleasant enough. Added this to the repertoire of my safe stash that I can always go back to if my skin decides to go full-blown crazy again. Regarding other physical sunscreens, I remember trying the Shigaisen Yohou in a store, and the application of that one felt much nicer, but it's also more expensive. If you have dry skin though, I feel like that's a better choice.

**Price**: I bought in on US Amazon for $13, which surprisingly is NOT tripled the Japanese retail price. Shocking.",t3_cbauns

829,AsianBeauty,[Discussion] Does anyone feel a bit self conscious about their pale skin due to avoiding sunlight?,"I can't be the only one that feels this. I'm an Asian male (mid 20s) who got obsessed with skin care after I had gotten moderate acne back in high school. Ever since then I've been avoiding the sun due to the fear of making my hyper-pigmented spots from acne even darker or worsening them. As a result I am pale as a vampire. Porcelain in colour. I know some of you might think, ""that's the skin colour I want"", that's fine, but as a guy, I can't help but feel less masculine, especially when I'm around my other male Asian friends who are all tan.

Being this pale has taken a toll on my confidence somewhat as I feel like I would get labelled. Labelled as in, some might think I'm a FOB (fresh off the boat) or someone who doesn't go outside. My relatives tell me I need to get a tan to get some colour in me/ I don't look healthy (even though I'm perfectly healthy). I can't be the only one that feels this. 

I look back at photos before I got acne, enjoying life in the sun and not caring about protecting it (while avoiding getting sun burnt). I looked healthier with that golden glow in my opinion. So here's a question, to what extent of sun exposure can it cause ageing in the long run/ wrinkles? I look at my sisters skin (shes mid 20s) and she doesn't care about avoiding/ protecting her skin as much yet her skin looks perfectly youthful with no wrinkles, no spots, not dry looking. Shes darker than I am because of sunlight. I want to get to that freedom again but also limiting myself.",t3_cbbo33

838,AsianBeauty,[Journal] 10 Year Skin Progress,"Hi everyone! This is my first post so let me know if I need to adjust or edit anything!

I wanted to share my 10 year skincare journey starting from when I was around 10-12 years old. It has been long and hectic but I have finally reached a point where I feel comfortable with my skin. I have shed many tears and experienced moments of intense frustration and self-hatred. I hope someone can listen to my story and regain hope :)

Skin type: Combination, acne-prone (especially T-zone), sensitive

After I hit puberty, my skin slowly became worse and worse. As an Asian girl, whose friends mostly had clear or clearer skin, this shattered my self-esteem. I was shy, withdrawn, and had terrible social skills (e.g. could not maintain eye-contact).

Phase 1: I’m sure many of you can relate. I tried drugstore products (neutrogena, St. Ives, Biore pore strips, alcohol-based toners, spot treatment all over my face etc.). I looked through youtube to find any home remedies. I tried everything, feeling desperate, but to no avail. I regret many of the things I did.

Phase 2: I discovered “natural skincare,” like the OCM and essential oil-based products. These, of course, broke my skin out even further. My mom finally decided to take me to a dermatologist, and I tried benzoyl peroxide cream but that only dried out my skin. I was seriously considering more serious medical treatments at the point in time. Although I wore makeup, random people would point out my terrible skin out in public. I remember one time I updated my FB profile with a slight filter, and one guy (a high school classmate) asked if I had used photoshop. I had little to no confidence in how I looked.

Phase 3: I found out about Asian skincare and my skin gradually became better, but I still took a lot of wrong turns. I first used popular brands like cosrx, etude house, and innisfree without analyzing the ingredients. Although my skin became more hydrated and even, the spots did not stop popping up. I also tried fermented products like the Kiku toner, only to realize that I was FA-prone. That was another revelation. I realized that I had to pay attention and track the ingredient lists of my products, so I began doing that. I realized that I was sensitive to A LOT of ingredients, which makes my routine pretty bland but my wallet happy haha\~ Some of those are: Alcohol (high in list), most oils (especially essential oils), fragrance, niacinamide (maybe), sodium acetylated hyaluronate, chemical UV filters, honey (maybe), anything FA-related, glycolic/lactic/salicylic acid (moderately), etc.). This all took so much trial and error, but my skin was finally improving.

Phase 4: After leaving home for university, I came to the conclusion that I had to take care of myself holistically. I needed to nurture my body, brain, and mind altogether. This occurred to me after my first experience of depression and anxiety. Therefore, I began watching what I ate. I reduced the amount of sugar, gluten (for digestive problems), dairy (except occasional yogurt and cheese), and general junk food that I ate. I exercised a little each morning when I felt energetic and well-rested. I found hobbies outside of coursework to ease my mental fatigue. I started going out more to improve my social skills. I also simplified my skincare immensely, cutting out anything I didn’t need. Even though it was tedious at first, all of these soon became habits. Through these past few months, I’ve felt significantly better both physically and mentally.

Conclusions + Routine: Everyone has a different path in terms of their skin struggles but please continue to keep pushing forward regardless of the extent of your problems. I believe that we can all have good, not perfect, skin. I know that there are genetic predispositions, which I believe pertain to the level of environmental sensitivity of the skin (e.g. food, hormones, stress, pollution). However, I believe that everyone has a range and when we make an effort, we can climb higher to clarity.

839,AsianBeauty,[DISCUSSION] How adamant are you with sunscreen/avoiding the sun on days indoors? Are you afraid of tanning or just UV damage?,"This is for indoors. I’m curious to see how far you guys take it because I kind of do - however lately, my black-our curtains and everyday sunscreen use has been wearing on me. 

I’m not sure if my body likes so much sunscreen everyday and my curtains make my room mustier than need be. I get worried - maybe even body dysphasia - over how tan I can get. My body has grown so accustomed to sun protection that I burn easily now, so I guess it’s back to being a perfect-skin vampire (:",t3_cahv30

847,AsianBeauty,[Discussion] Gel moisturisers or cream moisturisers?,"Hi everyone, I wanted to ask about opinions on whether you guys prefer using gel type moisturisers, cream types, or a mix of both?

Do you have any recommendations for gels and creams that go well together in a routine to boost each of their effects?",t3_ca4yo0
848,AsianBeauty,[Discussion] pH of hybrid products like the Laneige Cream Skin Refiner?,"I've started this discussion to see how you (collectively) feel about pH levels, if you know the pH of your products, if the pH makes an impact on your routine/order, or influences your product choices, and finally if anybody knows the pH of the new ""skip-care""/hybrid products like the hyped Laneige Cream Skin Refiner? Where would such hybrid products fit in to a ph-balancing routine? Can it really be used as a toner/essence/moisturizer like it claims? What kind of pH does it need to have to adequately fulfill all those roles?

Below are my own thoughts and a little background:

So I've been using probably 90% AB in my 5-to-10-step (depending on the time of day and season) skincare routine for nearly the last 2 years,  and although some of the products have switched up, I've overall seen great improvements with the traditional layering method. However, the biggest changes for me came when I started to deeply understand pH and its importance in healthy skin and I really got nerdy about the pH levels at which various actives work their best magic. 

See, I used to think that I had sensitive, acne-prone, combination skin, until I realized that my skin wasn't sensitive or combination - it just wasn't ph-balanced. Nowadays, I can use much stronger products without worrying too much about the scary introduction phase, as long as I know the pH of a product and can fit it into my routine. Hell, most times I can tell by the ingredients and pH level of a product before I try it whether it'll be a hit for me or not.

Understanding pH, and even going so far as buying my own pH testing kit for all my products, really helped me to get the most out of my routine by allowing me to better layer in an optimal order so that my various actives weren't at competing pH levels on my skin (e.g. some items needed to go in a slightly counterintuitive order based on their ingredients, or they needed to be alternated by time of day or on different days based on other products). This in turn helped me reduce irritation and reactions.

I loooooove my long, drawn out AB skincare routine at night, but I'm admittedly always on the lookout for ways to shorten my routine in the morning. That's why I'm intrigued by the Laneige Cream Skin Refiner, especially since, as I've discovered that my skin type is actually mildly oily during the summer, I would love to be able to thin out my daytime layers and feel a little more refreshed. However, as a ph-lover, I'm a little disheartened that more pH info isn't available for a lot of products unless I can manage to get my hands on the physical bottle myself and test it. I really wish the pH range of products was just a default printed on the label as easily as the ingredients. I feel like this would be really helpful and could even tell people when things were outside their safe range as pH often changes over the life of a product. 

So are there any other pH nerds out there like me? Has anyone found or tested the pH of the LCSR or other hybrid products similar to it?",t3_ca40f9

858,AsianBeauty,[Discussion] What are your favorite inexpensive products?,"I was hoping in this thread we could share our favorite inexpensive products. Now I know that what is considered inexpensive is subjective but I think that under $20 might be a good mark. Personally I prefer products to be around $15 and under so that's the range I'm going to be suggesting myself. 

Here are my favorites that hopefully someone on a budget may appreciate knowing about. (I'm getting my pricing from Amazon I promise I'm not a shill for it lol)

**Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil: $10**

Everyone knows about this one. It's popular and reliable. 

**Innisfree Bija Jeju Anti-Trouble Cleansing Gel: $15**

This cleansing gel has a nice pH and what I like about it is that it doesnt bubble up at all. It stays a gel the whole way through. Its very gentle on my skin and doesn't leave my skin feeling tight. 

**Cosrx Hyaluronic Acid Hydra Power Essence: $15**

This is a simple essence that sinks into the skin nicely. It sinks in better when my skin is damp. Otherwise it can be slightly tacky. It's a nice hydrator and even better when sealed in with a moisturizer. I have oily skin so I use this alone in the morning with no moisturizer and it gives me just enough hydration. 

**Mizon Water Volume Ex Cream: $13**

I use this moisturizer at night time only since it really gives me that extra moisturization thats too heavy during the day. However its a nice light gel cream that sinks into my face super nicely and feels really cooling. This really makes my skin feel so smooth but I might search for something a tad lighter in the summer month. 

**Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish Sun Milk SPF 50+ PA +++: $10**

This is a mineral sunscreen and may not be for everyone. It makes my skin more matte even if I apply it when I'm really greasy. For oily people this might be great but for people who want to look really dewy this is not it. Its really light, sinks in super fast, feels nice and dry right away and has a pleasant faint lemony scent.

So thats all for me! Leave your recommendations for your best budget products!",t3_c9ko0b

863,AsianBeauty,I buy things so you don't have to #1: MISSHA Flash-Up Sun SPF50+ PA++++ [Review],"I got this on a total whim because I was running out of ""indoor"" or transitory sunscreen and wanting something stronger as I'm starting to use Tretinoin from Curology and want stronger sunscreen protection.

I was using Etude House's Sunprise Mild Airy Finish whatever whatever, SPF 50 PA+++.

I grabbed this on Amazon cause it looked interesting &amp; and my ""indoor"" sunscreen matters less and I've been wanting to explore.My needs in a sunscreen are: must be somewhat mattifying and can NOT be too oily or greasy, number one rule. I may alternate between sunscreens depending on needs.

&amp;#x200B;

**Skintype: naturally oily t-zone, on tret &amp; use professional strength chemical peels, so flakes &amp; being dry are a thing now**

&amp;#x200B;

Anywaysss:

&amp;#x200B;

This is my first MISSHA sunscreen &amp; possibly first product used (anything else was a sample). I grabbed it due to SPF &amp; PA rating &amp; interesting packaging, tbh. I skimmed the comments and a couple online reviews and went for it.

I have used it a few times. I like the packaging, I also rlly like holographic things. It squeezes out pretty easily. It is quite creamy, it's lotion-like &amp; a little thick but not too much so. I don't particularly remember a smell but it wasn't strong if there is one. It spreads easily, though I do rub it in more than I am maybe supposed so.

It goes on looking like a horrible white cast, and will look sort of weirdly UBER SHINY or possibly UBER GREASY looking at first. This was a bit weird to me, but after a few uses, I've come to realize this was the ""flash up"" thing it advertises. It has a sort of uberly dewy &amp; somewhat ""holographic"" look to it when first applied, and if you're dark, you may see a white cast. This does go away after sinking in for maybe a full thirty minutes.It doesn't feel heavy, and has a satin finish once settled. It does NOT have oil control, but it doesn't boast this, so. I will say it definitely doesn't seem to make it worse. My oil breaks through it in maybe 4 hours ish, and it stays semi dewy looking all day. I haven't tried makeup over it, only translucent powder.I'm unsure if it's another product cause this seems to happen on other days I don't use this, but it may be a bit much for on top of lids, as in slight stinging later in the day.

**I won't repurchase but I'm glad I tried it - I would suggest for those that are not oily, so normal to dry. Use only if you're cool with a slightly dewy look, and don't plan to rush out of the house right after applying. Give it time to settle, maybe 30mins - 1 hr. I have no issue w/ this as this is my ""Idgaf or I'm only indoors"" sunscreen.**

867,AsianBeauty,[Review] Daily Mild Sun Cream Pair,"Bought [this sunscreen](https://www.peachandlily.com/products/daily-mild-sun-cream-pair) from Peach &amp; Lily. SPF 50+ PA++++

I just got back from a week-long trip in Iceland, where the sun currently only sets for about 2 hours/day (and even then, it doesn't fully set, so it's never truly dark outside) and I went on 10+ hour hikes a day almost every day. Even though it was Iceland, it was also unusually sunny - I'm from LA and most days it was honestly as sunny as it is in LA, which the locals said was very unusual. So basically it was a TON of sun exposure.

Y'all. This stuff is the STUFF. I have extremely sensitive skin that's also prone to burning and I often get new freckles. This was the first trip I've been on where I didn't even get a little pink, and I didn't get one new freckle! I only wore beanies, no sun hats or anything, so I have to chalk my skin protection entirely up to the Daily Mild Sun Cream. It definitely protected my skin during a week of intense sunlight!

The cream itself feels light, and a little goes a long way. I was very diligent about reapplying every two hours, so I was doing 6+ reapplications per day, and my face never felt really greasy or gross with all the sunscreen. It comes out of the tube white but applies on clear and glossy - but I'm also very pale, so ymmv on the color. It's actually almost borderline TOO glossy - if you're not ok with a glowy look, this probably won't work for your aesthetic. I can't imagine achieving a matte face with this sunscreen, though I have yet to try applying makeup over it - that said, I thought I looked great in it, just noting this detail for people who aren't interested in the glass skin look. 

The biggest (and only, for me) drawback is the amount in the bottles. As soon as I took them out of the box it was immediately clear that both bottles were only about half full. I only brought one bottle with me to Iceland, and by the end of my trip the bottle was nearly empty. I'm on week 3 of owning this sunscreen and I think I'll be done with the first bottle within the next few days - I'm looking forward to seeing how long the second bottle lasts under more normal circumstances. I don't know if I think the total amount of sunscreen for your money is unfair, but I DO think that the size of the bottles feels deceptive, and it was a little disappointing squeezing it for the first time and feeling a ton of air in the packaging. 

That said, the product was so effective and felt so nice that I will definitely be repurchasing. I've been on the hunt for a decent sunscreen for my sensitive, acne-prone skin for nearly two years, and this is easily the best one I've tried. 

Very excited to be contributing to this community - I'm so thankful for how much I've learned here, and I finally felt like I had some input to give back. Hope this helps someone!",t3_c9549h

Welcome the two newest mods to our team, /u/thecaticorn and /u/conceptizual! They’ve actually been about, doing various modly things for the last few months, and we are super late at properly welcoming them to you.


Our new mods were chosen after our selection process, and we have been slowly training and integrating them into the mod work. We had one other mod /u/4soeur, who was recruited at the same time, but has since stepped back due to an international move. She has extensive experience modding other communities, loves gardening, and is an accomplished mother. We wish her well and all the luck! 

And to introduce our remaining recruits, /u/thecaticorn is a strong person working on her independence after graduation, and /u/conceptizual is a cheerful, easy-going and personable human. We are so lucky to have them, and thank you both for volunteering your time for the community!

More hands on deck, and more fresh ideas to add to the team! Some fun facts about our new mods:

/u/conceptizual: 

* Software engineer, loves to build infrastructure, maybe even things like mod queues
 
* Heritage is half-Mexican, but with self-described “solidly mediocre Spanish”

* May be our first-ever extrovert

* Really wants a pet dog but not yet

* Kpop fan, even covers dances in her spare time.

* her favorite thing she did to improve her skin was “stop being 14”

/u/thecaticorn:

* Recent IT undergrad

* Australian Representing, Indian heritage

* Solid AB community veteran

* Like all good people, also loves Avatar the Last Airbender (And Korra!)

* Into bubble tea as self-care

* Snowboarding beginner

Ever thought about joining the team yourself? Help steer the direction of your subreddit community! We can sometimes take a while to respond to (as we are not always in a recruitment cycle), but
 we encourage you to consider applying. We especially wish to recruit from diverse timezones for better ongoing support of the sub during all hours. We are also hoping to add perspectives from folks from LGBT+/Queer/GSM/SAGA backgrounds, folks with disabilities, older folks, and anyone with a unique perspective and a dedication to the community. Come apply! 

We love the folks who are great at self-motivated learning, diplomacy, seeing all sides of an issue, and being a good team player, as you will be working on a team with other mods from around the world. Experience modding other subs or large communities could be helpful but not required.

870,AsianBeauty,[Review] Half-Year Review + Local Products?,"Edit: Will fix formatting sorry 😭


Hey ABers! It's my first time writing a review here. It's a challenging sub kinda like I don't want to disappoint the readers here haha. 

Anyway so I'm from a Tropical country, very humid and scorching heat everyday. I have Combination leaning towards Oily when it's summer and Dehydrated Sensitive skin. Its my first time to use this much product so I thought I'll share my thoughts on them. Also, A speculation is at the bottom of the review! Let me know what you think of it.


**Exfoliator**


**CosRx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid**


*7/10*


I'm surprised this was effective at all. It broke me out maybe once or twice. Didn't use it for a month then came back then it's okay. But as time goes by I never notice any improvements just a quick smooting the next day but it always goes back. Will repurchase but maybe in samples cause you don't need much then you don't also need to do everyday 



**Innisfree Jeju Volcanic Clay Mask**


*6/10*


I'm surprised somehow this never dries down. Broke me out at first and I didn't see effects. But I like how it made me feel like I'm doing self care for myself. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't I hate my face for being too sensitive. 😭


***Cleansers***


**Innisfree Jeju Cleansing Foam**


*7/10*


Bought this just because it's on a sale; heard it's high in pH but surprisingly doesn't dry me out. WRP only if I find other seller (tax was too high)


**CosRx Good Morning Cleanser**


*4/10*


I really wanted to like this! It's not drying compared to what I expected it but this cause me to have CCs that I never had before. Such a waste since it's really the cheapest

**Face Shop Dr. Belmeur Daily Repair Foaming Cleanser**


*7/10*


This one I really like. Checks all the boxes for me. Not drying, the smell wasn't too bad, doesn't leave residue and cleans really well. However I can't justify it's price for some reason. It's really pricey here in my country since I assume import tax.

**Human Nature Sunflower Oil**


*10/10*


I used this as first cleanser before using CosRx and damn if this product isn't the best! This product can be used in multiple situations too! When it's really cold and my skin cracks I use this on my legs and elbows. I also use this as facial oil, mixing it with some cream. I think it also heals insect bites but I'm not too sure about that. This is the best selling product of this brand so I bought it just to see what it can do and it deserves it! Really cheap too maybe around 4-5$. 

**Brandless Papaya Soap**


*8/10*


This was a localproduct and it's from a local family business. Surprisingly didn't broke me out! I'm usually skeptic when using brandless product because I don't know what's in it. But I was at a camping/party and it's the only one available at that time so I risked it. It dried me out though however it also dried out my active pimples! I will probably keep using this whenever I have breakouts.

***Acne Care***




**Human Nature Green Tea Acne Care**


*10/10 HG FOREVER*


When I say 10/10, it's 10/10. It's also a local brand but lately they've been expanding I think they sell online now. This is my go-to product whenever I have breakouts. Just dab it allover every night, every morning first thing on my routine and the acne will be gone in less than a week. It forms a film like texture to protect the acne from absorbing more dirt. My only complain is after using it for so many months probably years it became less effective in a sense that it will heal the acne a tad longer. I guess it's not even on the product but on my tolerance but I still use it for acne protection. Also very cheap, 4$!


**CosRX Pimple Patch**


*5/10*


Hated this just because it kept falling and irritating my acne. It was supposed to dry it but it made my acne more inflamed. Guess I have to just find a more effective one.


**Moisturizer**



**Soon Jung 10-Free Moist Emulsion**


*9/10*



I use this as Moisturizer sooo, this is super hydrating and the only one that really worked for me without purging or going through seven hells. In sunny or even hot nights I hated this just because it made me sweat on my philtrum area because it's really thick. I really love this im a sense that it's one of the few that didn't broke me out and leave scars. I bought the small version and I'm still using it for 6 months!

**Mizon Snail Cream**


*4/10*


Why. Did. This. Broke. Me. Out. I really wanted to love this!! It's the best feel from all that I've tried but I guess not everything works for my face.

**Mizon Snail Recovery Gel**


*8/10*


This is a must in summer! Leaves a matte texture, dries out quickly and doesn't make me oily throughout the day. I purged on this so bad I had to stop using it. But when I came back after a few months it was okay again! Guess I just have to try and try. I don't know what happened but I'm happy it worked. It has dimethicone in it which I didn't know so I used it on evenings which I think is not a good idea.

**Dr. Belmeur Ato Salt Cream**


*8/10*


Used it on first quarter of the year which is really cold and dry and this works like magic. I really loved how heavy and hydrating it is so I sometimes layer it twice. BUT used it on summer and this is a sticky mess. Heated my face and caused me to break out.

I'm planning to try out


- *Skinfood Sugar Masks

- More Actives (I'm kinda afraid of them because my skin just always self detonate when exfoliating)

- Kikumasamune Lotion

- The Face Shop Rice Cleanser

- Innisfree Green Tea Seed Serum

- More Local products

- Muji Toner and Moisturizer

- Laneige Water Bank*



Before I disappear I guess I wanna speculate how some local Products deem effective to my super sensitive skin. Is it because they're made specifically for our country's weather and majority of my nation's skin? Although I'm afraid cause there's a big risk of these products being discontinued as the sales are not as big as international brands. It's really amazing how all the local products I tried were effective. Or maybe it's just luck? Have you guys tried any local products that you really loved? I'm looking forward to seeing more potential local brands in the future!",t3_c94aw6
871,AsianBeauty,Verdict on humidity n storing away your skincare products?,"I keep my products on a bookshelf in my room (away from sunlight) but I have to keep my Muji diffuser on when I’m in the room in winter bc its so damn dry and doesn’t help w my dehydrated skin lmfao.

Not to mention the money it all requires.

I'm wondering how much time and money other people spend on skincare.

877,AsianBeauty,Trying to find cooling shampoo I used at a Tokyo onsen,"I hope this post is allowed here.

I'm trying to find anything on a particular cooling shampoo that I used at a Tokyo onsen and I've stretched out my Google skills in my jetlagged haze.

Am back home now so can't go back, but maybe if I describe it a bit, someone here can help me.

It was the Thermae-Yu onsen in Shinjuku, and it was a medium blue bottle (shampoo only) with the word ""cool"" in an oval on the front above its name in hiragana (I think?).  There was also a corresponding shower gel (""body shampoo"") in a lighter blue bottle, also with the ""cool"" in an oval over the brand name.

895,AsianBeauty,Your oily skin is NOT dehydrated,"I've run into this belief many times over the years: a person with oily skin should make sure to moisturize, since stripping the skin of oils would make the skin overcompensate with production of oils. This is incorrect, and the price I’ve paid for not doing any actual research on the topic has been shiny and oily skin. After I stopped caring about “overcleansing” and just started washing my face more often ceased moisturizing, except for my dry spots, I am now acne free and my skin no longer shines like a mirror.

The idea of overcompensation was dismissed by Miescher and Schonberg in a 1944 paper (Sakuma &amp; Maibach, 2012). They proved that the ratio between lipid delivery and size/number of glands is constant, which means that your skin produces a set amount of sebum over a given period of time. What this means is that if you have oily skin you shouldn’t be afraid to cleanse your face, as you might just have large and-/or vast sebaceous glands. It also means that your skin doesn’t “overcompensate” when you wash it too often – something which is in my experience frowned upon in certain parts of the community.

There is a great meta study from 2012 by Sakuma &amp; Maibach in the sources which goes into detail about oily skin, you should definitely check it out if you’re interested in the topic. I also posted a link to a referenced article by Kligman &amp; Shelley where they expand on the topic of sebaceous secretion.

Hope you learned something new!

900,AsianBeauty,Best pressed powder for super-oily skin?,"Hi there!
I have suuuper oily skin and acne scars ( rolling scar type). I am not precisely  a 10 step skin care routine fan person, I tend to minimize the steps as much as I can, and currently I am using as a cleanser Himalaya Neem gel, then Biore UV rich essence (occasionally ionally Before I spray some rose water as a toner). With these two I am very happy and I can say I’ve been using them for a long time, after many years of trying unsuccessfully with others. 
The thing is, I would like to find a good AND oil absorbing pressed powder, or pact, not too pale ( I guess I am one tone below the 23, because that one is just a little too pale)...I am currently using TONYMOLY Cats wink Clear Pact, which I honestly think is great, but it comes only in two shades, and the #2 is  too pale for me now that it’s Summer.

Sooo, that is why I am asking if anyone could give me their recommendations on similars pacts, pressed powders, but with wider shade spectrum, and  for oily skin ^^

Thank youu!!",t3_c81rh6
901,AsianBeauty,What do you think about Skinfood Black Sugar perfect Splash masks?," Does anyone use/have used the Skinfood Black Sugar Perfect Splash Mask ?

Do you use it daily (diluted with water) ? do you use it weekly (pure)?

What did it do to your skin ? Do you moisturize after ?

I have oily skin and i have incorporated aha/bha peeling (1-2/week), salycidic acid and azelaic acid (the days i dont use aha).

I just purchased it at Sephora as it was -50% (26eu to 12.50) and it's one of the last skinfood product they conduct in Paris..

*This is filled with some skin-loving/identical oils. One of the main points of mango butter is that it has skin soothing/healing properties, but it's not greasy. Honey is very good for skin because of its sugars and antioxidant value. Also, a few studies show that it can be healing for wounds. Royal Jelly, however, does not have any evidence of helping skin a whole lot.*

*Potentially problematic ingredients: The oils in this are great, but the high % olive oil may be bothersome to acne-prone skin types. YMMV.*

**Niacinamide 10% Treatment - 4.38/5 (50 Reviews)**

&amp;#x200B;

**PROS**

""The price!!!!!"" x50

Sensitive skin friendly

Fast results for some (5-7 days) in terms of better skin texture/overall appearance, more resilient/stronger/balanced feeling

Lightweight/watery, non-sticky

Lightly Hydrating

Few reviewers said it really worked in brightening their skin after using for a while (\~1 bottle) (Reviewer states you MUST use past 3 months to see significant brightening)

Brightened enough to switch to lighter shade foundation

Large pores disappeared

Improvement in uneven bumpy skin texture, makes skin soft, reduction in redness/inflammation

Inflamed acne is better

No fragrance

&amp;#x200B;

**CONS**

Many felt that they did not see an increase in noticeable brightness (some reviews said they only used it for like 3 days,,,, girl...). People expected DRAMATIC results because it's 10%!! (a lot of people used the English word ""dramatic"" to describe what they thought the results would be, lol.)

Doesn't help active acne

Recovery Booster performed better in brightening

Dropper is annoying

Not hydrating enough

Few people broke out pretty badly

Too watery

Very sensitive skin need to mix it with other products

*Amazing* at soothing upset skin

Absorbs well, lightweight

Acne disappeared

Really strengthens skin

Great for very sensitive skin

Really hydrating

Affordable

Unfragranced

Putting it on about-to-form zits makes them go away (lots of reviews in general talking about it calming their acne significantly)

&amp;#x200B;

**CONS**

Smells like shit

Wish it was more accessible (physically) - 2sol is an online-only brand

Too drying for really dry skinned people

Caused breakouts for few

Heavy when you put on too much (pump makes it hard to control how much comes out)

Didn't really see a difference

Also, it smells like shit

&amp;#x200B;

**PROS**

*Very* hydrating - lots of reviews stating how moisturized their skin feels compared to a routine without it

Light, absorbs well, non-sticky (slightly thicker than water)

Fast results! (Brightening) (\~2 weeks)

Doesn't pill under other products/foundation

Great ingredients for sensitive skin/effectiveness - no alcohol

Unfragranced/no strong smell

(Reviewers seem very surprised to find that the serum is not heavy despite the word ""recovery"" in the name.)

Calming for sensitive or inflamed skin

Skin actually did not look bad as it usually does when tired/sleep-deprived/stressed *(I get this effect too, from my Timeless vitamin C serum. My pores get giant and texture is all bumpy and weird when I pull a allnighter, but not if I use the vitamin c in my night routine.)*

Skin feels noticeably healthier

&amp;#x200B;

**CONS** (Most of the cons begin with ""I don't really have anything bad to say about it, but if I'm being really picky.."")

Really watery

Slight medicinal smell

Didn't see dramatic brightening (these users did not specify the length of time they used the product. The ones that did were disappointed to not see brightening after using for 10-13 days bc other reviews stated that they saw very fast results.)

Too strong for very sensitive skin

Stings on open wounds

Concerns about using it in the AM bc sunlight *(Not sure why some reviewers feel this, because there's nothing in there that's photosensitive? Maybe it's the belief that vitamin C makes you more sun sensitive. But it actually boosts your sunscreen and has a photoprotective quality!)*

913,AsianBeauty,[Guide] Hwahae Rankings: Top 30 Creams &amp; Emulsions/Lotions (06/29/2019) PART ONE + Skin Barrier Education,"Hwahae: It's a review/ranking app for Koreans for beauty-related things. I'm making some top 10-20s for each category for those of you guys who cannot read Korean or don't use the app. Thanks!

Ingredients from various websites, double checked with ones from Hwahae, or typed straight from Hwahae.

&amp;#x200B;

*I'm really excited about this section. I'm not happy that Korea is and has been for years, swamped in pollution from the winds carrying it over. There is a lot of microdust and even people with resilient skin reported getting redness &amp; severe irritation from the pollution. Everyone has to wear these giant masks, sometimes special ones, and limit their exposure to the world outside of their homes.*

*So there has been a lot of push for soothing, calming products and ""clean"" ingredients. A lot more focus on repairing the skin barrier. So I'm excited about those, but not the fact that people have to suffer.*

*I'll be bolding some of the soothing, repairing and/or skin-identical ingredients in the ingredient lists. I don't know every good ingredient, but I will bold the ones that I do know of. Some other beneficial ingredients as well.*

*\*Also got random pictures of the textures of the creams and the users who posted it.*

*If you're interested in barrier repairing/replenishing as I am, here are some good quotes from Susan, from Swift Crafty Monkey blog:*

&gt;**Natural moisturizing factor (NMF)** is found within the corneocytes, and makes up 20% to 30% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum. It **consists of amino acids (40%), sodium PCA (12%), lactate (12%), urea (7%), ions (18.5%), sugars (like glycerol – 8.5%)**, and a few other things. These are water soluble [humectants](https://swiftcraftymonkey.blog/better-crafting-through-chemistry/) (meaning they draw water out of the atmosphere to our skin) that have a huge impact on the biochemical and mechanical properties of our skin. Having an adequate NMF level in our skin can prevent or reduce skin tightness, cracking, scaling, and flaking. It improves our skin’s plasticity (thanks to the interactions of the amino acids with keratin) and helps maintain skin’s barrier properties.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Filaggrin** is a really important protein found in our skin! ...When we are in more arid climates, the filaggrin breakdown increases to produce more NMF. More NMF is a good thing!  
&gt;  
&gt;The contents of the NMF do more than act as humectants. The lactate and potassium can affect the pH and stiffness of the stratum corneum. The lactic acid stimulates ceramide biosynthesis and improves barrier function. The [hyaluronic acid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan) (HA – picture to the left) maintains hydration and structural integrity of our skin. It also interacts with intercellular lipids and regulates the mechanical properties of the stratum corneum.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[The strateum corneum lipids\] make up about 15% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum, and contain about **40% to 50% ceramides, 20% to 25% cholesterol, 15% to 25% fatty acids** (those with C16 to C30 chain lengths, with C24 to C28 being the most common), and **5% to 10% cholesterol sulfate**.  
&gt;  
&gt;Oils with **linoleic or gamma-linoleic acid** are always welcomed by our skin (like sunflower, sesame seed, borage, evening primrose, rice bran, and others), especially in the winter.

**Squalane, beeswax, lecithin, lanolin** are also good skin replenishing ingredients. Shea butter is very soothing and moisturizing, as well as having a lot of antioxidants.

*I'm not super familiar with the plant extracts but I'm guessing they're for healing/soothing. Glycerol and Glycerin are the same thing, and Hydroxyethyl Urea and Urea are basically the same thing for our purposes. I personally am very interested in this cream bc it seems LOADED with skin soothing and replenishing ingredients. Some very antioxidants in there too, like astaxanthin, as well as blueberry, pomegranate, fig, mulberry, albeit super small amount.*

*Panthenol, d-panthenol, or dexpanthenol is awesome at healing and soothing. 2-4% is okay too, but it has absorbency issues, so 5-10% is when it's really effective (according to Susan). But perhaps penetration enhancers make this better. Squalane is the stable version of our skin-identical friend. Looks like this has a high % of madecassoside as well, that I haven't seen elsewhere yet.*

914,AsianBeauty,Dupe for Pony Effect Favorite Fluid Lip Tint?,"Hello! First time posting here so sorry if I did anything wrong!

I’ve tried a lot of lip tints already but because of my lip shape (size? Plumpness? Haha) combined with them just being dry, they all end up uneven on me. The only ones that have worked are the balm based ones (which do not last as long) or the oil-based ones.

That said, Pony Effect’s favorite fluid lip tint goes on glossy/hydrating and dries down matte like a true stain, which is why it worked for me. Unfortunately i recently had to throw mine away as it was just too old and i have only been able to buy them when I visited seoul :( none of the online stores that ship to my location carry it either.

Would anyone know of a good dupe for it? To be specific, I’m not fond of the bright shades AB lip tints mostly offer. I liked Pony’s because it pulled as an MLBB color on me (in the shade “Very Good”). I currently have the EH Dear Darling in PK003 and it is a color dupe but as I’ve said it turns out patchy :(

Thanks in advance!!!! Xoxo i’m blessing everyone with skin hydration and bounce!",t3_c7crsr

Some people expected it to be an exfoliating toner but found out it's not (didn't we all lol). I use this as well, and I really like it. It's very soothing with 0.5% salicylic acid.*

916,AsianBeauty,[Guide] Hwahae Rankings: Top 40 Skins/Toners (06/28/2019) PART ONE,"Hwahae: It's a review/ranking app for Koreans for beauty-related things. I'm making some top 10-20s for each category for those of you guys who cannot read Korean or don't use the app. Thanks!

Ingredients from various websites, double checked with ones from Hwahae, or typed straight from Hwahae.

&amp;#x200B;

*In Korea, toners are called ""skin"" (although more recently ""toner"" has caught on as well, probably from Western influence/to make it easier to sell in the West). Usually, lotions mean light emulsions. Sometimes it can mean something between ""emulsions"" and creams, I think, in terms of texture/thickness. ""Lotion"" in Japanese however, are toners from what I understand. Oops!! I meant to put 6/29 in the title. :x*

You can make ""banchan"" (side dish) with them, a bunch layered on top of each other drowned in soy sauce mix, or a spicy version with red pepper powder and garlic and such. Sometimes it's used as a wrap for meat. It's thick and kinda hairy feeling if you eat it fresh/raw. I much prefer it made into banchan to get rid of that hairiness.*

**1.** \[**BEPLAIN\] Cicaful Ampoule - 4.34/5 (3,174 Reviews)**

30ml/29,000 KRW

Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth-20, Polyglycerin-3, Pentylene Glycol, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Sodium Hyalutonate, Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate, Lactobacilius/Rice Ferment, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Xantham Gum, 1,2 Hexanediol, Ethyhexylglycerin.

*The few reviews I have read for this say that it absorbs fast, is pretty soothing, and some people state that it really helped their acne. The expectation seems to be that it's supposedly very good for acne prone skin. There are pictures of someone with pretty bad acne showing before and after pictures of their acne going away. (Korean skin care is more geared toward CALMING &amp; SOOTHING acne than to go to war with it with drying treatments and whatnot. I guess because a large component of acne is inflammation?)* 

*Some people said it doesn't seem to do anything for them, sensitive types seems to like it a lot, that it absorbs quickly. They like that it's unfragranced. Some VERY oily types said they feel like their skin is a little bit more oilier when they use it and that it doesn't absorb well for them. It may be really popular due to Director Pi suggesting it as the #1 soothing ampoule in her recent video. I see Director Pi's name pop up quite a lot in reviews in general.*

**2. \[BADSKIN\] Collagen BOMB Hydrating Ampoule - 4.28/5 (5,002 Reviews)**

*Reviews for this basically say that this is ULTRA moisturizing. A little bit on the heavier side so oily skin may not like it, but all the dry skinned people seemed to really, really love this. It's cheap, very hydrating, absorbs well. However, a few oily people said it takes a little bit to sink in for them.*

*This is a very popular product. This and their Galactomyces Niacin Ampoule have been consistently on #1/somewhere in the top 20 list since their debut in 2012 according to Director Pi. This ampoule has been #1 for like forever from what I'm gleaming. However, their expiry is 2 years unopened, and 6 months opened. Supposedly studies done by Estee Lauder say that bifida ferment has been shown to strengthen your skin barrier over time and make it less sensitive to things. Director Pi says ferments provide very, very gentle form of exfoliation.*

*Honestly, I feel like a lot of these rankings, except perhaps the first top 10, is slightly arbitrary. Just because it takes the # of reviews into account. You can find lots of good reviews vouching for very good products with lesser amount of reviews. It doesn't necessarily mean that just because a product is extremely popular, there can't be lesser known amazing products as well. For some categories, like toners and creams, I feel that it's worth to look all the way down towards the 40s and 50s. I think I will make certain categories longer if you guys don't mind my spamming, lol.*

925,AsianBeauty,[Discussion] Favourite Products ft. Panthenol,"**What are you favourite AB products featuring Panthenol, and why?**

There has been threads centred on Vit C,  Niacinamide and a dozen other ingredients, but never panthenol, so I thought I'd start one.

*A Lil Note on Panthenol:*

&gt;Panthenol is the alcohol form of the B vitamin pantothenic acid. Panthenol is used in skincare products as a humectant because of its ability to attract and hold moisture. Research has shown it aids in wound healing, improving the skin's barrier function, restoring damaged epithelium as well as reducing itching and inflammation. Panthenol is usually used at concentrations ranging from 0.5-5%, although 2-5% has been shown to be the ideal concentration in promoting wound healing and repairing skin damage.",t3_c6xova

I've tried Canmake's balm line and really enjoy them, and have an Opera lip tint that never seems to give off the amount of color I'd hoped for.

Thank you in advance!",t3_c6pobx
927,AsianBeauty,"Tosowoong's S.O.S. Cica Madecare ointment, undisclosed steroids, and companies refusing to name ingredients in ""proprietary formulas""","Update 7/3: A photo of the quasi-drug fact sheet was found! No steroids listed, woo!

\------

I recently purchased the Tosowoong SOS Repair Cica Clinic Madecare Ointment based on a recommendation I saw here. One user said it was super calming and erased the redness on her post-waxed legs almost immediately, like magic. A couple others have mentioned using it daily as a sleeping pack, which is what I purchased it for. I gave it a try last night on my face while having a itchy red flare-up from allergies and irritation, and sure enough, the itch went away in seconds and my skin calmed down entirely within minutes. I was, to put it lightly, shocked. The only time I've ever experienced that type of instantaneous relief before is when I've used topical steroid creams like hydrocortisone.

I've been concerned with product labeling on ""soothing products"" ever since 2014, when [Mario Badescu was caught putting undisclosed steroids](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lawsuit-filed-against-mario-badescu-for-undisclosed-steroids-279184841.html) (hydrocortisone and triamcinolone, a prescription-only steroid) in their Healing Cream and Control Cream for years. Of course, as soon as the steroids were removed from the formulas, customers were hit with steroid rebound syndrome (severe redness, burning, and sloughing) and some customers suffered irreversible skin thinning and atrophy as a result of long-term steroid use.

I did a search for ingredients but came up empty handed. I also tried to reach out to Tosowoong (in English) for a list of their ingredients, but they haven't responded to me. I did a search and apparently others have tried to ask Tosowoong for the ingredients of this ointment, and they have refused to disclose them because it's a ""proprietary formula."" Does anyone know if this is still true?",t3_c6u55u

931,AsianBeauty,[Guide] Testing out Japanese sunscreens,"I saw a Japanese article that looked really interesting so I thought I'd share with you guys :)   


https://i.redd.it/h7ye2246y0731.png

This article tested out 18 Japanese sunscreens to find the best sunscreen based on these criteria: 

1. Sun Protection  
They used these UV boards (will show up later in the post), put sunscreen over them, and left it out for 5 minutes. If the board is slightly pink, it means that some UV rays got through.   


2. Feel  
They checked for stickiness after applying a second time, spreadability, white cast, and fragrance. Note that this is a Japanese website so white cast may be unreliable for your skin tone. 

3. Water Repellency   
This test was used to see how the sunscreen would hold up when you're sweaty. They used artificial leather, applied sunscreen and waited for 30 minutes, dropped water on it and picked it up to see how much water fell down. The less water left on the leather, the better.   
(OP note: kinda iffy about this test because they tested some non water resistant sunscreens. I think it's still interesting though.)

4. Gentleness   
\+5 pts if they only use zinc oxide, 4 pts if they have chemical UV scattering agents, 3 pts if they use a mix of scattering and absorbing agents, 2 pts if they use chemical UV absorbing agents, additional +0.5 pts if they don't use alcohol

5. How easy it is to wash off  
After leaving sunscreen on a strip of artificial leather for 3 hours, they used a foaming cleanser to wash off the sunscreen. The less residue left, the better.   


Now, they tested 18 sunscreens but I picked out some of the most popular sunscreens on this subreddit. I also decided to only include the picture of the UV boards because the original article was pretty picture heavy. If you want to see the full list and pictures, you can see it at their page: [here](https://the360.life/U1301.doit?id=6361)

This weekend I'll cover Essence/Ampoule/Serum and Cream sections. There are also Cleansing Waters, Lip/Eye Remover, Skin/Toner section, Lotion/Emulsion, Gel, Mist, and Face Oil sections, but I'm not sure if I'm going to cover all of them. Let me know if you do want a section covered. I'll try to cover them.

&amp;#x200B;

In the future I want to cover:

\- Top 20 sun lotions/creams (maybe also Sun sticks section and Sun Cushions)

\- Sleeping packs!

\- BB/CC Creams (separate from Foundations, Cushions, Tone Up Creams)

\- Makeup Base (there is a separate section for primers)

\- Shading (contouring products)

\- Eyebrow makeup (maybe also Eyeliners)

\- Lip tints

\- Lip balms/Lip Care

935,AsianBeauty,"[review] 6 months into Asian skincare long and honest review (tony moly, cosrx, the face shop, acwell, benton, hada labo and mizon)","**EDIT** the face shop rice oil gave me perioral dermatitis,irritated my face and gave me red bumps in my eye area i dont recommend this if you are sensitive to fragance (even when dtays short time on your face can irritate) 

**first** of all I want to apologize for any mistakes my mother language is not English **second** this will be a long post and many well known products will be here so I’m sorry if this is redundant to you and also this is my first review ever (I’m so excited!!)

This review will be divided on 3 parts: information about my skin and my current routine, reviews and products, brand and ingredients I want to try this second semester.

**1.** before I found out about Asian skin care and this subreddit my skin was covered by painful and inflamed white heads, tons of closed comedones , black heads, PIH and was dull and super dehydrated ( I did not know about dehydrated skin) my routine consisted on kiehls calendula cleansing gel and calendula toner in the morning (yes, no sunscreen and no moisturizer), in the evening same cleanser and toner plus a small amount of kiehls ultra facial cream.

**Skin type** sensitive prone to dehydrated (25y/female)

**Issues** dehydration, black heads on nose and PIH (yes I got rid of white heads, CC's and dullness)

**Location** where I live we don’t have seasons the temperature goes from 17° (in the coldest days) to 30(super hot days)° not humid or dry and very polluted.

**Current routine**

**AM**

Wash with cold water (skipping cleanser in the morning made a huge difference)

mizon snail repair eye cream

cosrx advanced 92 snail all in one cream

**2 reviews**

I decided to try tony moly first because it’s the only Asian skincare brand with physical stores in my country

***tony moly wonder rice smoothing toner (5/10) won’t repurchase again:*** this was my first Asian toner, this slightly smoothed my face, not very hydrating, worked for the 7 skin method. did not improved my hyperpigmentation, deeply hydrated or exfoliated my skin as it claims, did not damaged my skin neither this was just normal was like putting home rice water on my face. good content and cheap may work for really sensitive skin.

***tony moly the chok chok green tea watery essence (4/10) wont repurchase again:*** at first I felt in love with this essence (I decided to ignore the smell of alcohol ) made my face look so glowy and fresh I even applied 2 layers or mixed with my foundation until after 2 or 3 weeks I started to get some redness and irritation at the end of the day, I decided to stop using this and the irritation and redness went away also some CC's . it’s so sad because this gave such a beautiful glow to my skin that I never have before, I tried to use it again in my new routine but with the same bad results.

\*\*\*tony moly goat milk premium moisture cream (1/10) wont repurchase again:\*\*\*Ok people so far this is the worst moisturizer that I ever tried, this gave me white heads and CC's every time I tried it, sits forever on my face and smells awful the only reason I don’t give it a 0 it’s because this kind of helped to heal my moisture barrier. I gave it to my dad who broke out too and he gave it to my mom who could not stand the smell.

***cosrx good morning low ph cleanser (3/10) won’t repurchase again:*** unpopular opinion but I wanted to love this cleanser so bad but it was a big disappointment. this never washed off I made a post and some other people said they had the same problem (many people told me that the water of my city could be the problem) also my face felt tight after this. I liked the tea tree smell on this, it was also cheap.

***cosrx aha 7 whitehead power liquid (8/10) may repurchase again:*** I’ve been using this for 3 months this was my first chemical exfoliator I introduced this slowly first once a week , now twice a week and from next week will use for 3 times a week. I stopped getting white heads before this so I can´t tell if this actually works for them but pretty sure this helped me to get rid of closed comedones. I love that there is some niacinamide on this, does not irritate my skin but whenever I use this I know my skin will need some extra hydration.

**cosrx one step original clear pads (10/10) will repurchase again:** I’ve been using this for 3 months, this was a game changer when my skin was a completely mess pretty sure this helped me to get rid of CC´s and whiteheads. I use this when I feel my skin is about to act up (I’m a model and sometimes I get super heavy editorial make ups or multiple make ups in a day) and at the end of the day I notice some small cc's(not sure if they are cc's but they’re small not read bumps), weird red bumps and irritation) I use this and immediately my skin feels calm and soothed and the next day the bumps are mostly gone. this helped my brother with his cystic acne

***cosrx advanced snail mucin 96 power essence (10/10) will repurchase:*** I don’t want to talk so much about this, it’s a well known product, became HG, help scarring process my entire family end up using this too

***cosrx advanced 92 snail all in one cream (9/10) won’t repurchase:*** my skin drinks this, this makes my skin glowy and plump sometimes at night I use two layers of this and my skin looks so hydrated in the morning, I don’t love the sticky texture but once applied it gets absorbed in less than 30 mins. the reason why I won’t repurchase it’s because I think 2 snail products in my routine its redundant I will like to try other creams with ceramides, green tea ...

***hada labo gokujyun hyaluronic acid lotion moist (9/10) won’t repurchase:*** this is a well known product. did not notice a huge change until I started layering multiple times, does not break me up, I love how good this is for my prone to dehydrated skin but I already ordered the premium version.

***the faceshop rice water bright light cleansing oil (2/10) won’t repurchase:*** this was my first oil cleanser ever and I can't tell how I lived so many years without this step. this get off heavy makeup and mascara so easy , make my skin feel soft and I notice a reduction of black heads in my nose on the other hand this sting and irritates my eyes and blurry my vision I think I will replace this with hada labo cleansing oil or heimish all clean balm

***mizon snail repair eye cream (7/10) wont repurchase:*** I spent a month without eye cream, I was just tacking my other products to the eye area (hada labo hyaluronic acid lotion, cosrx snail mucin essence and cream) and then I ordered this to compare so I could decide if eye cream is worth it or not. I don’t notice any difference I want to try some other eye creams but I’m reaching the conclusion that they are not worth it (I’m open to recommendation)

***Benton snail bee high content steam cream (2/10) wont repurchase:*** I ordered a travel size kit from Benton I was so excited to try this but was such a big disappointment, first thing I hated the texture so thick felt that I had to rub this on, my skin normally drinks every cream so fast but this kind of sits in my face letting me look greasy, also I had the first white head in months :( and some closed comedones around lip area

***acwell licorice ph balancing cleansing toner (9/10) may repurchase***\*\*:\*\* not so long ago I made a post here looking for the perfect cleansing toner and so many people raved about this. I’ve been using this for less than a month but it’s exactly what I was looking for its a gentle toner that helps me to clean de residues from the night I just wash my face with water in the morning but is not enough to remove dust and sweat, this toner does the job and I noticed that when I used my skin feels so soothed and fresh I’m dying to try de mist version. I don’t give it a 10 because I think it’s too pricey for such low content, I love the packaging and the natural herb smell on this.

**3 new haul:** as i mention before i ordered a travel kit from benton products and i really want to try the benton snail bee high content essence and the aloe bha toner.

i also have on my haul the pyunkang yul moisture cream, essence toner and moisture serum (im dying to try this)

**waiting for:** shipping to my country takes forever but melaco cc and hada labo premium lotion are on my way.

**Whats on my shopping cart:** innisfree no sebum mineral powder, meishoku caracolla perfect gel, klairs fundamental ampule mist, cosrx bha power liquid, cosrx hydrium green tea aqua soothing gel cream, heimish all clean balm, etude house suun jung ph6.5 whip cleanser

**im looking for:** A dupe for ***tony moly the chok chok green tea watery essence*** that does not contain alcohol

**curious about:** klairs, purito and asian sunscreens",t3_c6ch6j

Is Avobenzone the only UVA filter... How can it have PPD 16+? It seems Ensulizone (which is primarily a UVB filter) can get a boost in UVA protection when combined with Avobenzone and while this excludes the Octinoxate filter, it shouldn't degrade Avobenzone. 

Is it possible to achieve it with these filters and this specific combination and if so why don't US companies do it? Anyone else find it strange how this can have such a high PPD rating?",t3_c6iow9

956,AsianBeauty,[REVIEW] Biore UV Perfect Milk SPF 50 ( 2019 Formula / Blue bottle ),"I recently got this and have been using it for 2 weeks. It wasn't until after buying it where I've read about the reformulation and people's concerns with it. I have not used the old formula but here's my take on this one:

1. It is affordable - I got it for $15CAD for 40ml
2. The finish is MATTE. I read people complaining that it is greasy and never dries down, but I've never experienced this. I shake the bottle REALLY well and the product comes out opaque white. I have extremely oily T zone but drier around my chin area. Dry skin folks - AVOID
3. Takes a while to fully mattify. I would say 10-20 minutes.
4. I wash my face using Hada Labo Rohto Gokujyn Hyaluronic Acid Cleansing Foam, followed by ROHTO Melano CC and Cerave moisturizing lotion before applying this sun screen on top. 
5. Very little white cast initially but seems to go away after a while.
6. I would say the finish is like the Australian Gold tinted sun screen (which I also talk about here) but lighter and comfortable.
7. I was worried about the alcohol level in this as well, but so far it has not irritated my skin.

959,AsianBeauty,[Review] Benton travel kit,"I’m 22 with combination skin that is also very sensitive. Recently I ran out of skin care products and I found this little kit at a very good price in an online store so I decided to buy it since I’ve tried some benton products before and they worked for me. 

https://i.redd.it/em6c1f03gf631.jpg

I haven’t tried the Honest cleansing foam since I’m currently using neogen green tea and I didn’t want to waste its expiration date. As well as the cleansing water because I don’t use make up other than mascara that I clean with coconut oil.

Aloe propolis soothing gel. It’s as good as any other aloe vera gel. I tried it before when I was introducing myself to korean skin care and tbh I prefer other brands that are less expensive and have way more product. I mean it’s good but for it’s price I prefer other options that have more % of aloe

Aloe BHA skin toner. I also tried this some years ago. I like it because it feels refreshing. It’s a nice toner but nothing special.

Snail bee high content Essence. I never tried an essence before. I really like this, it feels good but I see nothing special on my face. I think it feels like a toner. I’ve been using it for three weeks and already running out of it. 

Fermentation Eye cream. I’m just getting started with eye cream, never really mind about it since I’m only 22. I like this, I don’t know how an eye cream is supposed to feel but I think this feels kind of thick, I don't mind it tho. I’m not sure if I have seen results or I’m just sleeping better. I don’t know if I would buy it again, I feel like it’s a little expensive and my under eye problem is not that bad so maybe I’ll keep on trying other brands. 

Snail bee high content steam cream. I feel like it’s a good moisturizer but it does make my skin a bit… oily? it feels very thick. I’m only applying it at night and on my cheeks since I’ve recently have breakouts in my forehead. It feels good but I'm scared it would cause me break outs if I apply it to all my face. 

Overall I think it’s a good starter kit for anyone who hasn’t tried korean skin care before. Plus it comes with a nice pouch. The aloe products are really good and I would buy them again. The snail bee products may be a little too much for my skin type.",t3_c52cy7
960,AsianBeauty,[Discussion] Has anyone tried the Muji Clear Care Skincare series?,"Recently I paid Muji a visit, and to my surprise found a skincare line I had not noticed before called the 'Clear Care' series. More information online [here](https://www.muji.com/hk-en/skincare/clearcare/). According to their website, the products are targeted towards acne prone skin and minimising pores, overall refining one's skin balance. It also contains hyaluronic acid for its hydrating properties and natural fruit extracts.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm always on the hunt for new products to try, and I'm honestly just curious as so whether or not this skincare series actually works. My combo skin with oily pores could potentially benefit from the products.

* Have you tried these products, and what were the pros and cons?
* Do you see any changes in your skin balance (acne/pore reduction)?
* How does this perform in comparison with the popular Muji Sensitive Skin series?
* Is the price worth it?

I noticed a lot of people were upvoting the comment and thought this might be something to share. Get ready to scroll forever.

I originally tried to post this with the “Review” flair, but it wouldn’t go through. These are all reviews, not necessarily recommendations, and not necessarily related to science. I also tried to post with “Research,” but that didn’t work, either, so “Science” it is.

I’m a huge nerd who loves to have an app for everything. I definitely don’t think *anyone* should ever need all of these apps. **Please note that I live in Japan and am on an iPhone SE and a Mac**, so this excludes any apps that are unavailable to me. Also, I have a bit more time on my hands than usual at the moment, so this definitely gets pared down if I’m busy.

Please remember that it’s on each and every one of us to decide whether to trust any given source or not. I am neither scientifically inclined nor a beauty expert in any way. Any additions (not necessarily for me but for anyone reading this) are welcome!

# SKINCARE ROUTINE/TRACKING

If I were to pick just one app to use for this category, it would be either Skincare Routine or Curél肌手帳. Or Day One (with TextExpander) if the purpose is to pare down the sheer number of apps I have, because I would still be keeping it either way.

&amp;#x200B;

**Skincare Routine**

* **Links:** [Official website](https://mento.co.uk/skincare-routine/), [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1428570992) ($2.99 USD), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.theordinaryguide.app) (320 JPY)
* **Official description:** *Learn how to use DECIEM (The Ordinary, NIOD, Hylamide &amp; Fountain) products and create a personalized regimen for your skin care &amp; beauty treatments.*
* **Frequency of use:** Twice every day, but it’s only been a few days

I’ve known about this app for some time, but only just downloaded it based on the recommendations on the aforementioned thread because I don’t have any non-DECIEM products at all.

While you *can* set up “custom” (non-DECIEM) products, it takes a little time, which goes for any app that can’t automatically pull information for your products. I do like that you can also add things like hair products (which I haven’t added) and supplements (which I have added).

The products you’ve selected or entered are automatically put in place in your skincare routine (which can be different for AM/PM or specific days of the week, etc.) and you can check off products as you go each day, which is my favorite part of this app. The order doesn’t always seem to be perfect for custom products, but the checklist makes everything go smoother, and I like the indicator that tells you whether you used it in AM/PM routines over the past week, as well as the optional timer.

There is also a skincare diary function, which I don’t really use (see Day One for that; I may eventually decide to switch to Skincare Routine for that, but I was already using Day One so I’m sticking with it for now). It also gives you tips, tells you what ingredients shouldn’t be used together (though you have to be really diligent about entering information for any non-DECIEM products), etc. There’s a lot of attention to detail and I definitely haven’t mentioned everything here.

Overall, I think it’s a great app. I would even venture to say it’s almost everything I wanted in a skincare routine app. The one real problem I have with it is that it doesn’t respond to my taps/swipes very well (which could be specific to iPhone SE), so it can get a little frustrating when I’m using it. In fact, the interface feels cramped on my phone in general, but that goes for more and more apps these days. I also wish it could pull information for non-DECIEM products, but I doubt my mostly-Japanese products would be included anyway. Currently I’m trying to decide whether the tapping/swiping problem is enough to be a deal-breaker.

&amp;#x200B;

**Day One**

* **Links:** [Official website](https://dayoneapp.com), [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1044867788) (free), [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/day-one/id1055511498) (free); subscription-based premium plan
* **Official description:** *From once-in-a-lifetime events to everyday moments, Day One’s elegant interface makes journaling about your life a simple pleasure.*
* **Frequency of use:** A few times a day every day, but I use it for non-skincare purposes too

I use this mostly because I already had it on both my phone and my computer, with a premium account to boot. I made a separate Skincare Journal, where notes about my skincare routine, anything notable (new products, new pimples), and photos go. All of these can be covered by the Skincare Routine app above, but the thing about Day One is that you can lock it too. No one needs to see the most unflattering selfies in the world, not to mention close-ups of my nose and the like. It’s also convenient that I can use it on both my phone and my computer. I wouldn’t be using it nearly as much if it weren’t for the syncing with TextExpander (explained below), though.

&amp;#x200B;

**TextExpander**

* **Links:** [Official website](https://textexpander.com), [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/textexpander/id1075927186), direct downloads for Mac/Windows/Chrome on website; free for 30 days with subscription plans after that
* **Official description:** *TextExpander lets you instantly insert snippets of text from a repository of emails, boilerplate and other content, as you type – using a quick search or abbreviation.*
* **Frequency of use:** Any time I’m using my computer or any app on my phone that can sync with it (like Day One)

I know the subscription plan means it’s not for everyone, but I can’t live without TextExpander. I’ve also tried using another similar app in the past, when they first took the subscription route, but TextExpander seems to be better overall *and* it’s also available on my phone. You can use it with any app using the keyboard function, but I don’t like the keyboard and only use it when I really need it for an app that won’t sync snippets. Fortunately Day One is one of the ones that do (Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Update TextExpander Snippets).

Basically, you can set up specific snippets (e.g., ffanclo) that automatically expand to something else (e.g., Fancl Mild Cleansing Oil). That particular example can be set up in your default keyboard too (General &gt; Keyboards &gt; Text Replacement), but the thing with TextExpander is that you can also set it up to expand to a block of text, like my usual AM/PM routines, which can then be edited as necessary to reflect anything I did differently. The snippets can be case sensitive or not, the expanded text could be formatted or not, etc.

Again, like Day One, I already had the app and subscription for other purposes. As this one is only free for 30 days, I especially wouldn’t recommend it unless you also want it for non-skincare purposes. (That said, it’s completely essential for me in my professional life, and would wholly recommend it for anyone that thinks they might need it.)

&amp;#x200B;

**Habitify**

* **Links:** [Official website](https://habitify.me), [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1111447047) (free), [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1140787122) (free), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.unstatic.habitify) (free); subscription-based premium plan
* **Official description:** *Habitify is both a habit tracker and an accountable buddy that helps you form good habits while saving the most of your time.*
* **Frequency of use:** A few times every day, but this could change re: skincare

Also something I already had for other purposes. I use it to track/remind me to take supplements, to use actives I don’t use every day, etc., but I think the Skincare Routine app mentioned above might be able to take its place in that respect. This and other similar apps (there are a ton out there, I just happened to like this one, one big reason being that it’s also available on macOS) might be a good fit for you if you want to track and/or be reminded of specific things but don’t want to bother tracking your entire skincare routine.

&amp;#x200B;

**TroveSkin**

* **Links:** [Official website](http://www.troveskin.com), [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/troveskin/id1435184918) (free), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.trove) (free)
* **Official description:** *Analyze and track your skin – Measure your pores, wrinkles, spots and more to get personalized skincare recommendations*
* **Frequency of use:** Almost every day, but I’m thinking about deleting it

I think this app encourages obsession, so this definitely isn’t for those of you whose mental/emotional health is suffering in any way. The Skin Score and Skin Age fluctuate like hell and I’m convinced they mean nothing, so personally I have no problem ignoring those, but admittedly my heart sinks a tiny bit when my ratings for Spots/Pores/Texture/Wrinkles are lower than usual. I’ve never gotten anything but Excellent for one of those categories, but this just means I might start completely obsessing over it as soon as I get anything other than that. This is why I’m thinking about deleting the app. (And there’s also the thing with having these super-unflattering selfies on an app that can’t be locked, but it’s not like I don’t lock my phone anyway.)

One thing I really do like is how you can not only track and do side-by-side comparisons of selfies but also specific parts of your face, without having to take multiple photos. But then again, it uses the front-facing camera, which definitely isn’t great on my phone. The interface suffers a little, once again, on the screen of an iPhone SE (it looks nothing like the screenshot on the official website, by the way, so I’m a little confused). It also lacks a bunch of functions in Japan, but I think that may be a blessing. Like the Skincare Routine app, this also has a diary function where you can track products and other factors, but some of it is a pain on an iPhone SE.

&amp;#x200B;

**Curél肌手帳** (in Japanese only; may only be available in Japan)

* **Links:** [Official website](https://www.kao.co.jp/curel/special/curelapp/), [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1179625502) (free), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.kao.curel) (free)
* **Official description:** Curél肌手帳は乾燥性敏感肌の方のために考えられたお肌の記録アプリです。
* **Frequency of use:** Deleted, but may reinstitute at some point

This was the first skincare-specific app I used. It’s a skincare journal app made by Kao to promote their Curél brand, which is meant for dry sensitive skin. It’s a perfectly good app if you can read Japanese (actually, you might be able to use it based on the icons if someone helps you through the initial setup), and I might start using it again if I decide I can’t bear using Skincare Routine.

This is not just for skincare products and your face – you can also track stress levels, sleep, exercise, drinking, bowel movement, your menstrual cycle, the weather, and problem areas on your face, body, and scalp. And with a text field for notes about anything else. It’s super comprehensive without being overwhelming – you just tap on some icons to track these things, or nothing at all for the weather – and you can add non-Curél products too (although it helps for me that I have multiple Curél products in my routine). The one thing it doesn’t have in comparison to the other apps is any support for photos.

The only reason why I’m not using it is because I’m already tracking some of those things in another app, and I didn’t want to bother entering the same information multiple times. Also, you can obviously skip whatever you don’t need to track, but for some reason I feel the need to try to fill in every single blank, which is why something like Day One is better suited for me – I can be as detailed or minimal as I like on any given day without feeling bothered by it.

You do need to be okay with Kao having your information, I’m sure, but as a repeat Curél user, I would actually want them to be aware of my skin problems so that they could factor them in somehow in product development.

# FOR BEAUTY PRODUCTS

The winner for me here is Google Sheets, but I guess that isn’t really what you want to hear if you’re reading this. Maybe Beauty Keeper?

&amp;#x200B;

**Beauty Keeper**

* **Links:** [Official website](http://beautykeeperapp.com), [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id827915841) (free; 240 JPY to remove limits)
* **Official description:** *Beauty Keeper is a stylish, easy to use and handy app for iPhone that tracks expiry dates of your beauty products, reminds you when it is time to replace them, and helps to determine production and best before dates encoded by manufacturer.*
* **Frequency of use:** Only occasionally, but I find it helpful

I only started using this recently, but I wish I had it earlier. It pretty much does what’s in the description and nothing else. It’s one of those no-frills apps focused on a specific purpose, and that can be a very good thing. This comes in handy for products that I don’t use on a regular basis – they’re more likely to expire without being used up, and I don’t want them cluttering the products section in skincare routine apps. I also wouldn’t be entering makeup in my skincare apps, obviously. I still haven’t entered everything I own, but I’m making sure to enter anything I buy and I know it will help me down the line.

One minor gripe is that I can never use the batch code lookup because most of my products are Japanese and/or Japanese-market-specific. But I’m sure that will be the case with any app made outside of Japan.

&amp;#x200B;

**Google Sheets**

* **Links:** [Official website](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/), [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id842849113) (free), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.docs.editors.sheets) (free)
* **Official description:** *With Google Sheets, you can create, edit, and collaborate wherever you are. For free.*
* **Frequency of use:** Almost every day

I felt kind of weird looking for a page to link to for the official website. If you use Reddit, you probably at least know what Google Sheets is if you don’t use it already. But just in case you don’t, it’s the Google Drive version of a spreadsheet app, like Microsoft Excel or Numbers on macOS/iOS. You can also use it in your browser [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/).

Because I have more time right now, I finally sat down and made a spreadsheet, initially to understand UV filters and [my various sunscreens](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/bz8r9t/japanese_sunscreens_allie_extra_uv_gel_highlight/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) better. This expanded to include my skincare products, and then to also include makeup. This has kind of become a pet project at the moment, and I’m still adding to it all the time. I did consider making separate spreadsheets for each category, but I didn’t want to keep adding ingredients to multiple sheets – I don’t really know my ingredients, so I’ve been copying-and-pasting information from several sources. It’s kind of becoming a mega-resource, and I kind of want to share, but (a) the copy-and-pasted information would be infringing multiple copyrights, and (b) it’s always possible that I misread something and/or copy-and-pasted to the wrong cell – I’m definitely not as careful as I would be if it were for work – and I would hate to spread incorrect information.

While I understand perfectly that spreadsheets are not databases, and that this is not the “right” way to use the app, it does give me the ability to search and reorder the information by column, which is particularly useful for the mega-sheet on ingredients. Because I’m bilingual, I have everything in both English and Japanese, and I don’t have to be confused about anything that I only know in one language or the other. I also find the Grouping function very useful, because there are columns that only apply for specific kinds of products (like sunscreen), and I use Conditional Formatting a lot, too.

* **Frequency of use:** More often than I would like to admit

This is the app version of the old-school cosmetics review website in Japan. I’ll write more about the website itself below, under Online Resources. I use it not only for research but also to document my notes on specific products (as reviews). There are other similar websites/apps that are probably easier to use, but this is the old school one and I’ve been using it for years. I personally don’t use the product-scanning function, but I imagine it would be handy for those of you who can’t read Japanese and want to check what the rating is for something you see in a store. (That said, I do have a few things to say about the ratings.) I *am* guilty of standing around in stores scrolling through reviews to decide whether something might be worth checking out or not.

I know there’s an English version of the @cosme website (discussed below), but I don’t think there’s an app. (Let me know if I’m mistaken!)

&amp;#x200B;

Apps I deleted within minutes but might possibly be worth checking out for others: **EWG’s Healthy Living App** ([official website](https://www.ewg.org/apps/), [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id703155791), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skindeep.mobile)) and **Think Dirty** ([official website](https://www.thinkdirtyapp.com), [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id687176839), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thinkdirty.thinkdirtyapp)), which are both for checking the safety of the ingredients used in your products. Both seem to be basically unusable for Japanese/Japanese-market-specific products, which is the majority of what I have. I’m also becoming increasingly wary of fear-mongering about various ingredients after doing research for my mega-spreadsheet discussed above, so I might not be using them much anyway. But who knows, maybe they could be useful.

&amp;#x200B;

# ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS: UV INDEX

Most of these apps (also in the next section) can be replaced by heavier-duty weather apps, but the ones I have require several taps to get to the information I want, so these more focused apps are useful to have.

&amp;#x200B;

**IFTTT** (specifically, the “Get a notification reminder to put on sunscreen when the UV index is high” applet)

* **Links:** [Official website](https://ifttt.com), [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id660944635) (free), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ifttt.ifttt) (free)
* **Official description:** *IFTTT is the free way to get all your apps and devices talking to each other. Not everything on the internet plays nice, so we're on a mission to build a more connected world.*
* **Frequency of use:** 24/7, in a way – I rarely open the app, but it’s always running in the background to run various applets automatically

IFTTT is pretty old school, and may be threatened by Shortcuts on iOS (I don’t keep up with the Android platform so I don’t know what the deal is over there). Shortcuts still has various limitations, though, so it isn’t quite obsolete yet.

This is another one I already had for other purposes, but [this applet](https://ifttt.com/applets/Pp5DH7sT-get-a-notification-reminder-to-put-on-sunscreen-when-the-uv-index-is-high) by Weather Underground to “Get a notification reminder to put on sunscreen when the UV index is high” is something I would recommend for anyone. It tells you when the UV index is 6 or higher, so that you’ll be sure to wear sunscreen. I wear sunscreen regardless, so I mostly think of it as a heads-up to take further precautions as necessary. Because… (continued in the next review)

&amp;#x200B;

**UV Index Widget**

* **Links:** [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1100568288) (free); one-time purchase or subscription-based pro version (hourly forecast downloads only available for latter)
* **Official description:** *UV Index Widget - Worldwide is a handy little app to check the current radiation level from the Sun (the UV Index), the highest UV Index forecast for today, and the forecasted UV Index for the next 7 days, anywhere on Earth. You can also add the UV Index to your Today Screen using the accompanying widget, set notifications for when the UV Radiation exceeds certain levels, and automatically add the UV levels to your Apple Health app.*
* **Frequency of use:** As often as any weather app; every day if you count glancing at the Today screen

I should probably start by disclosing that I suffer from sun allergy. I’m sure most people don’t need a seven-day hourly forecast for the UV index, but because of my specific problem, I find it very useful. It’s also useful to be able to swipe to my Today screen and see a diagram with the UV index graph for the day. I have to say the seven-day forecast can fluctuate quite a bit, though, so be aware of that.

&amp;#x200B;

**UVLens**

* **Links:** [Official website](https://www.uvlens.com) (where you can also check the UV index, from your browser), [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1060878359) (free), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spark64.uvlens.mobile) (free)
* **Official description:** *Exposure to sunlight’s ultraviolet radiation (UV) can damage your skin, cause sunburn and increase your risk of skin cancer. UVLens shows you when you need to take care and when you can safely enjoy the sun.*
* **Frequency of use:** Any time I’m outside

This one should be enough if you just want the UV index, without a widget or a bunch of forecasts like the app above. There’s also a sunscreen reapplication reminder, which I find useful, though I could arguably just set a normal timer on my phone too. You can set things like your skin type and activity level, though I have no idea how much these actually change the notifications in the app.

&amp;#x200B;

Also sun-sensitivity-related: **DMinder** ([official website](http://dminder.ontometrics.com), [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id547102495), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ontometrics.dminder)), which seems really useful, but I’ve been too lazy to use it properly. I really should, though, because I have a vitamin D deficiency, which I’m sure goes hand in hand with sun allergy. Basically it tracks your vitamin D levels as best you can without actually having your blood analyzed.

&amp;#x200B;

# ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS: AIR POLLUTION

As I mentioned, I live in Japan, and high levels of PM2.5 and Asian dust wreck my skin. There are specific products made to ward off these particles, so I would check these apps during certain times of the year to see whether I should be using them. These particles also make my eyes itch, so I’ll know whether it’s because of this or whether I should be looking for some other cause. Again, these can be looked up in heavy-duty weather apps, but it takes too many steps to get to the information I want.

&amp;#x200B;

**AirVisual Air Quality Forecast**

* **Links:** [Official website](https://www.airvisual.com/air-quality-app), [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1048912974) (free), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.airvisual) (free); direct download for Android (for users in China, it looks like)
* **Official description:** *The most trusted and reliable air quality information brought to you from the world’s leading air pollution data provider. Covering 10,000+ locations from a global network of government monitoring stations and AirVisual’s own validated sensors.*
* **Frequency of use:** As needed; pretty much never these days, but there are times when I use this every day

I find this to be pretty well-designed, and it’s always a major plus for me when the app looks good. The only reason why I also use the other app is because I have to tap on each day and scroll down to see the specific pollutants (although the photo on the official website suggests that might not be the case if you have 3D Touch – another limitation on the iPhone SE).

&amp;#x200B;

**大気汚染予報** (in Japanese only)

* **Links:** Official website, [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id631049880) (free), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.norikistudio.android.aerosol) (free)
* **Official description:** 九州大学応用力学研究所から提供されている「SPRINTARS」の予測（大気汚染粒子 PM2.5、黄砂 SPM）を、都道府県ごとの天気予報風に表示するアプリです。そのほか、環境省から提供されている「そらまめ君」の速報値を見ることもできます。データの取得方法に一工夫を加えることで、データ通信料とバッテリー消費量を低減しています。
* **Frequency of use:** Same as above

Not nearly as pretty as the other app, but it gives me a very straightforward presentation of the level of PM2.5 and Asian dust at different times of the day for today and tomorrow, and a forecast for five days after that, all in one screen. It also lists the weekly forecast for different areas of Japan (so it’s very Japan-specific, not sure whether it would be useful at all in other countries) in another screen, specific measurements in specific areas on another, and an animated map showing the movement of either PM2.5 or Asian dust in yet another. All in all, it’s a great way to check this information at a glance if you can read Japanese; you can probably also still use this even if you can’t read Japanese, if someone can tell you what’s what when you first download it.

&amp;#x200B;

# ONLINE RESOURCES (IN GENERAL)

I noticed in the thread I linked to at the beginning that some people were interpreting “apps” to include websites, which I definitely don’t think are the same thing, but figured it would be beneficial to include them in this post for that reason. While I’m reasonably sure there aren’t a whole lot of big app nerds who know all of the apps I just talked about, I imagine many of you will know more websites than I do, so this might not be as useful (or maybe none of it is, who knows).

Once again, please remember that it’s on each and every one of us to decide whether to trust any given source or not. I am neither scientifically inclined nor a beauty expert in any way.

&amp;#x200B;

# ONLINE RESOURCES: PRODUCTS

I also look for reviews on blogs, YouTube, Amazon, and Reddit, but besides that and/or if I don’t have time to do a lot of searching…

&amp;#x200B;

[**アットコスメ（＠ｃｏｓｍｅ）｜日本最大のコスメ・美容の総合サイト**](https://www.cosme.net) (in Japanese only – English version reviewed separately below)

@cosme claims to be and probably is Japan’s biggest website on cosmetics and other beauty products. I think I’ve had an account for something like 15 years, and have posted more than 90 reviews to date. Unfortunately it’s a great example of how poorly designed way too many Japanese websites are – it looks like it was made in 1999, which coincidentally is when the service started (according to [Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/@cosme)), and I actually don’t remember it ever looking any different. (Insert huge rant on Japanese web design here…)

But because it’s ancient, it has become a *massive* database for a ton of reviews by tons of different people with different skin types and in different age groups. I do like that they show this information next to each review, to give you a little bit of context. They also have a bunch of other things going on – blogs, Q&amp;As, articles, a retail version of the website – but I only ever look at it for the reviews and product overviews (the official press blurb and, usually, the launch date, which isn’t always easy to figure out).

So it’s useful in a lot of ways and I refer to it all the time in spite of the horrible design. THAT SAID. I do think that there are way too many incentivized reviews, though they do give you the option to filter out any reviews by people who didn’t buy the product. This totally skews the ratings and rankings, obviously. It also messes with the “sort by number of reviews” function, and it gets really annoying after a while as a whole, because there are just *so many* of them. You can read my full rant [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/c3ar7p/news_cosme_the_best_cosmetics_awards_midyear_2019/errqm3t/).

There are other similar websites/apps that are probably easier to use, but again, I’ve had an account for ages and sometimes it’s the only way for me to remember that I’ve used some product or another in the distant past.

&amp;#x200B;

[**@cosme is Japan's largest beauty and cosmetics portal site.**](https://us.cosme.net)

This is the English version of the website described above. It’s always so embarrassing when English versions of Japanese websites have these awkward sentences as titles… There’s tiny text at the bottom saying: *Our website is translated for audiences in Japan that understand English, regarding reviews, ranking and information for products sold in Japan.* Fortunately it’s nowhere near as cluttered as the Japanese version, but it looks really strangely bare-bones, like it’s still just a wireframe.

Do any of you actually use this? I had to enter a new user name (though the same one of the Japanese version worked), my gender, and date of birth all over again to use this website with the same account as the Japanese one. Which I only did just now, so I can’t actually tell you anything about it. The newest reviews I’ve seen so far are from 2017, but maybe the product information aspect could be useful. Again, I haven’t really looked at many of them yet.

This version of the website is also available in Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and Hangul. I can’t read those languages (not really, anyway) so I have no idea what the quality is like.

&amp;#x200B;

# ONLINE RESOURCES: INGREDIENTS

These are the websites I either referred to or considered referring to while working on my overwhelmingly obsessive spreadsheet’s ingredients sheet. I think Shiseido and Coop’s databases/dictionaries came up a few times when I was running searches for ingredients in Japanese, but I haven’t been using them actively, since most ingredient stuff tends to be easier for me to understand in English. But not always, so I may eventually end up adding information from Japanese sources too.

&amp;#x200B;

[**SkinCarisma**](https://www.skincarisma.com)

I really like the idea of SkinCarisma. There’s *a lot* of information for *a lot* of products, even some Japanese ones, and that potential overload of information is organized extremely well. I like that they show EWG hazard scores and CIR findings rather than just one or the other. I was very impressed as a whole – until I tried looking up one of my favorite products, [Allie Extra UV Gel](https://www.skincarisma.com/products/allie/extra-uv-gel-spf50-pa), and found a really obvious mistake: I love this sunscreen and all, but it most definitely is NOT alcohol-free. The list of ingredients says ethanol, not ethanolamine. SkinCarisma also skips over triethylhexanoin, and lists Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer instead of Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, EDTA instead of Disodium EDTA, and Hyaluronic Acid instead of Sodium Hyaluronate (or maybe some of these are actually interchangeable – I’m not qualified to say). Also, BHT has a score of 4, not 6, [according to the EWG’s own database](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/700741/BHT/), but maybe that was updated after the data was entered on SkinCarisma or something.

At first I thought maybe the list is for an older formulation, but I’m pretty sure it’s contained alcohol for as long as I can remember, based on how it smells. Maybe this is a fluke and they just had some problems with this particular product, but I would be sure to compare the list with the official list of ingredients, just in case.

I really do like how they organize the information, though, and it’s making me consider adding new columns to my spreadsheet. (When will it end… Oh, right, probably when I don’t have time any more.)

&amp;#x200B;

[**CosDNA**](http://www.cosdna.com)

I learned about this website through this community. It’s available in English, Japanese, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified Chinese; I’m assuming the Japanese version is the original, based on the length of the FAQ pages. It seems like a popular criticism is that there’s absolutely no information about their sources. For what it’s worth, [the Japanese FAQ page](http://www.cosdna.com/jpn/help/ingredients_qna.php) says the ratings are based on CIR, RTECS, and FDA data, as well as DERMAdoctor, Sage Advice, Skin Deep, [biodizionario.it](https://biodizionario.it), and publications by experts around the world. See link for more details (in Japanese). I’ve found multiple results for the same product before, though, and I find it a little confusing in general.

So, I’m sure it’s a great resource for a lot of people, especially if you don’t have time to look up all the ingredients yourself and/or you can’t find a list of ingredients anywhere else, but I think I’ll stick to working on my mega-spreadsheet.

&amp;#x200B;

[**EWG’s Skin Deep Cosmetics Database**](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/)

The EWG has been called into question by multiple people who would know better than I do (examples [here](https://chemistscorner.com/why-the-ewg-skin-deep-database-is-still-a-dubious-source/) and [here](https://www.acsh.org/news/2017/05/25/dear-ewg-why-real-scientists-think-poorly-you-11323), Reddit discussion with arguments for both sides [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupRehab/comments/7vi9gf/psa_for_researching_cosmetics_ingredients/)), and I’m careful not to read too much into the ratings, but it’s still a convenient resource. I don’t interpret high hazard scores as ingredients to avoid, but rather as an indication that I might want to read up on it a bit, just in case. I’m really not informed enough to catch real problems with the database, beyond there being any hazard scores at all for ingredients with “None” for the data it’s based on, but I *have* come across listings where the information is given in a confusingly inconsistent manner, like colorants.

One complaint I have after looking up a billion ingredients is that I wish the dropdown menu wouldn’t keep fluttering down and covering the search box every time I accidentally move my cursor over it.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Ingredients | Cosmetic Ingredient Review**](https://www.cir-safety.org/ingredients)

Basically the CIR equivalent of the EWG database above. It pretty much links you to PDFs with research related to the ingredient. I would read them if I really was trying to learn about a specific ingredient, but for the purpose of my mega-spreadsheet, I cheated and just looked at…

&amp;#x200B;

[**CIR Findings | Cosmetic Ingredient Review**](https://www.cir-safety.org/cir-findings)

The “Quick Reference Table” includes all of the ingredients in one PDF. The key is on the bottom of the very last page: *S - safe in the present practices of use and concentration SQ - safe for use in cosmetics, with qualifications I - the available data are insufficient to support safety Z - the available data are insufficient to support safety, but the ingredient is not used U - the ingredient is unsafe for use in cosmetics UNS - ingredients for which the data are insufficient and their use in cosmetics is not supported*. You’re welcome.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Cosmetic-Info.jp：化粧品の成分表示名称 検索条件入力**](https://www.cosmetic-info.jp/jcln/search.php)

This is essential for the bilingual part of my mega-spreadsheet. You can search by either the official Japanese ingredient name or the INCI name, and other more advanced settings that I haven’t needed to use yet. If this database is wrong, my spreadsheet is pretty much fucked. It could potentially be of use even if you can’t read Japanese; copy and paste the Japanese ingredient name in the first text field and hit enter.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Ingredient Dictionary | Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary | Paula's Choice**](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary)

I’m sure there are certain things that would need to be taken with a grain of salt here too, especially because this is on the website of a particular cosmetics brand, but it’s convenient and easier to understand than actual studies (I’m not science-literate, sue me).

&amp;#x200B;

[**INCIDecoder - Decode your skincare ingredients**](https://incidecoder.com)

I haven’t actually used this yet, but it looks like it might be useful. Basically you can look up ingredients by their INCI names, and it gives you a breakdown in plain English.

&amp;#x200B;

# ONLINE RESROUCES: INGREDIENTS – UV FILTERS

As I mentioned, I have sun allergy and the spreadsheet started out with sunscreens.

&amp;#x200B;

[**BASF Sun Care Portfolio – UV Filters**](https://www.eurotradingonline.it/focus/sun-care/guida-completa-filtri-uv-basf/) (click on the button to download PDF)

This is what I looked at, but I really wish I could find a resource of this nature on BASF’s own website. Or so I was about to say, except I *just* found…

&amp;#x200B;

[**Products | BASF's Care Creations**](https://www.carecreations.basf.com/product-formulations/products/)

I’m definitely going to go through and check up on all the UV filters listed here. How exciting!! (I really do have problems.) BASF is, by the way, “a German chemical company and the largest chemical producer in the world” ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASF)).

&amp;#x200B;

[**The Lab Muffin Guide to Basic Skincare – Lab Muffin Beauty Science**](https://labmuffin.com/lab-muffin-guide-basic-skincare/)

There’s a really great, easy-to-understand table with information about each UV filter in Lab Muffin’s e-book. The free sample PDF also includes this table. Lab Muffin is a science educator with a PhD in chemistry, who also runs [a blog](https://labmuffin.com) and [a YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/labmuffinbeautyscience).

&amp;#x200B;

[**UV Filters Chart: Sunscreen Active Ingredients | Skinacea.com**](http://www.skinacea.com/sunscreen/uv-filters-chart.html#.XQ9f1i2B0mo)

This one’s very detailed too – except I got a little confused about the maximum percentage. It’s not for the US because it includes non-FDA-approved filters, but it’s not for Europe either, because it also includes PABA, which they state is banned in Europe. Maybe it’s for Canada or Australia? [The About page](http://www.skinacea.com/about.html) for the website didn’t tell me anything about this either. If anyone knows, do tell.

&amp;#x200B;

Plus other random pages I found while searching for each UV filter, because I definitely put in more effort here than I did for other ingredients.

&amp;#x200B;

979,AsianBeauty,Review of Korean Sunscreens by Saerom Min (Founder of Romand),"Hello! I wanted to share this video by Saerom Min, a Korean Youtuber. She's the founder/owner of the brand Romand, which I've seen mentioned here and there on this subreddit. I made a similar post on /r/muacjdiscussion under a now deleted account lol. Realized I was posting too much personal info on that one, so I nuked it to start fresh.

I'll be summarizing the video through bullet points, otherwise I'll be repeating the phrases ""She says"" or ""Saerom says"" way too many times. So please remember that nothing I translate reflects my opinion. I'll be sharing my own opinion in a separate comment after publishing this post.

Link to video: https://youtu.be/rHHxqyrUZzk

Video Introduction: Snippets of what the video, talking about how important sunscreen is, etc. She used the sunscreens she's about to recommend for as short as a month for some and up to years for others. There are different types of sunscreens, so she will also talk about the best way to apply each kind. Her criteria for judging the sunscreens are: SPF, ease of application, how naturally the sunscreen sits on her skin, how well the sunscreen interacts with foundation. Says she will specify when a sunscreen is good to use under foundation.

Onto the sunscreens!

**Hera Sun Mate Stick** [picture of product](https://imgur.com/Ll6G94r)

* SPF 50+/PA++++
* This is the stick version of the [Hera Sun Mate Daily](https://imgur.com/F3sqhcv), which she used way back during her blogging years for over 10 years. Probably used over 10 bottles.
* Best stick sunscreen she's used
* Only has been using it for a month, but has [used this much already](https://imgur.com/Rw7ypxQ)
* Smooth application and very lightweight
* Matte finish
* [Left side is without product applied, right side with product applied](https://imgur.com/B4kb4nR)
* Apparently has this thing where she hates the feeling of any kind of product (lotion, foundation, etc.) on her hands, but doesn't have that problem with this sunscreen because no stickiness is left behind.
* Feels like you've applied nothing.
* Rather than using it before makeup, better to use all-day when you're going bare-faced and you'll be outside a lot.
* Application method: Swipe on and then tap with fingers.
* Random bit about how her boyfriend thought the sunscreen was a case for AirPods.
* Because this isn't a product you apply with your hands, you may miss some spots if you aren't careful. 
* Application method in detail: Apply stick from inside your face to outside in one motion. Don't do swiping motions, or it'll increase your chances of missing a spot. Don't swipe back and forth. Swipe in one direction (inside to outside). Be careful around nose area, as it is easy to miss a spot. 
* Same applies for when you apply on your neck (swipe in one, uninterrupted direction, top to bottom)
* Tap product in with fingers. Fingers also come in handy to check if you missed a spot. Make sure to blend into hairline as well.
* Method for reapplication: First blot oil/dust on your face with tissue. If you don't, dust from your face could get onto the stick, and that's not good. Then repeat application method described above.
* This product is great because it doesn't feel heavy at all when you reapply. Doesn't leave bits behind as you apply it. Really feels like you haven't applied anything. 

**Goodal Green Tangerine Vita C Dark Spot Tone Up Cream** [picture of product](https://imgur.com/i3C8Sua)

* SPF 50+/PA++++
* This product is actually a product placement! However, even if she didn't get the offer, she would have recommended this product anyway.
* This product is actually marketed as a tone-up cream rather than a sunscreen.
* Applies like a lotion.
* Tones up the face naturally (which in Korean means like brightening)
* [Left side is without product applied, right side is with product applied](https://imgur.com/5JNadVC)
* Instead of making your face white and chalky, it makes your skin seem brighter and clearer.
* There are lots of tone-up creams that apply like a light lotion, but most of them do not have SPF. This product has the best of both worlds.
* As a makeup brand owner and as someone who sells tone-up creams (among other products of course), she knows that adding SPF to tone-up creams makes it lose its ease of application, but this product as the best of both worlds.
* So this product accomplishes three things: tone-up, moisturizing makeup base, sun protection. Can decrease the amount of products you use before/during makeup.
* She uses this product either bare-faced with a natural tone-up, or underneath makeup. Application method differs for both.
* Bare-faced: She uses her left hand for the right side of her face and vice-versa. Reason: The angle allows you to apply the product more thoroughly this way. 
* Applies [this much](https://imgur.com/OfGdOCe) on the back of her hand.
* Applies [this much](https://imgur.com/bx3wbK3) on her right cheek and uses her left hand to spread/rub product in, blending down to neck.
* Tap product in to prevent it from pilling/moving around.
* Same for left side of face, but using right hand.
* Apply inside to outside for forehead, blending into hairline.
* Lightly tap into under eye area (since that area has weaker/thinner skin)
* Make sure to tap well around nose area so product doesn't pile up around the sides.
* [Before and after.](https://imgur.com/jifP0rb) Natural tone-up.
* For areas you'd like extra protection on, or for areas you'd like to bring forward (highlight), add another layer, but be careful. It's a tone-up cream so applying too much can wash you out.
* [She applies on forehead, bridge of nose, tops of cheeks](https://imgur.com/4XdKFd1)
* Instead of rubbing, tap in product. Products like this (that are like light lotions) are good for layering because they don't end up caking up.
* Application method for underneath foundation: Basically the same as the bare-faced method but *a lot* more tapping around so that it doesn't cake up with your foundation, especially around nose area. 
* She uses a liquid foundation for this video. Dots the foundation from inside her face to the outside and prefers a sponge over a brush.
* Press in with sponge. Result will look good (non-cakey) and last longer.
* Went on vacation to some hot country and tested this sunscreen with her makeup. Obviously her foundation didn't look 100% the same at the end of the night as it did when she first applied, but the foundation wore nicely and didn't break apart weirdly.

* SPF 50+/PA++++
* Clarifies this video has nothing to do with Krave Beauty creator Liah Yoo. Saerom simply enjoys this sunscreen and is on her 2nd or 3rd bottle. Her mother enjoys it, too.
* Product itself reminds her of condensed milk. Liquidy and transparent. No tone-up at all. 
* [Left side is without product applied, right side is with product applied](https://imgur.com/MEuEMbO)
* Label on back of product claims it's light, fresh-feeling, and isn't oily. But in Saerom's experience, it doesn't feel that fresh and she feels slightly oily as time passes with it on.
* HOWEVER, the reason she is recommending it is because it works with foundation so well, especially with long-lasting, matte foundations like Estee Lauder Double Wear. Doing so cancels out the negatives of each product. 
* Says Double Wear applies more nicely with Beet the Sun. [Before and after with Double Wear](https://imgur.com/JTcciJe)
* In the summer, people tend to prefer long-lasting, matte foundations like ELDW. Beet the Sun really works well with foundations like ELDW.
* Slight tangent about SPF in foundations. (I don't think it's relevant to this post, so gonna leave it out. Will translate if anyone is curious)
* Beet the Sun helps you apply heavier foundation so it sits on your skin nicely without caking up.
* Application with makeup: [Start with about this much](https://imgur.com/LU1cKVT). Apply on face like she did with the Goodal sunscreen. Make sure to tap product in well before putting on foundation.
* Says you look dewy/moisturized rather than oily after application. [Here's a pic](https://imgur.com/271bsew)
* Likes that it isn't very sticky. 
* Next: Applying ELDW. [Start with about this much](https://imgur.com/dlBldWE) because ELDW has such high coverage.
* [Dot on face like so](https://imgur.com/ZPm0B7t). Her tool of choice for this is those cushions that come in cushion foundations.
* ELDW sets quickly, so dot and work and on each part of your face instead of dotting all over first.
* Make sure to start with only a little product or it can cake up. She then puts on another layer of foundation and applies in the same method.
* For those who avoid foundations like ELDW because they seem too heavy/cakey: Using a sunscreen like Beet the Sun and applying minimal product in light layers can be helpful, especially during the summer.
* [Result of Beet the Sun + ELDW](https://imgur.com/U8xCbhl)

**Shingmulnara Oxygen Water Face &amp; Body Sun Cushion** [picture of product](https://imgur.com/96S13ZT)

* SPF 50+/PA+++
* It's [bigger than most cushions](https://imgur.com/xJiURzr), so the mirror in it is also bigger. Convenient for touching up on the go.
* Product is soaked in the sponge inside the compact. [Here is a picture.](https://imgur.com/q8L8Wxd)
* It is a physical sunscreen, so leaves a slight white cast, but not as bad as other sunscreens. [Left side is without product applied. Right side is with product applied.](https://imgur.com/S8iv1H5)
* Personally doesn't use physical sunscreens because they break down weirdly on her face, but this sunscreen seems to disappear rather than break down.
* She only uses this when she is going barefaced. Does not work well with foundation.
* She's recommending it because it's so convenient to use the days she's going barefaced. Easy to apply because size of cushion, doesn't cake up upon reapplication, and, as mentioned, disappears with time rather than breaking down on her face.
* Word of caution: Cushions in general pick up a lot less product than, for example, squeezing out sunscreen from a tube. So she really does not recommend it for when you'll be outdoors for a long time.
* She personally uses this sunscreen when she knows she will be barefaced the whole day. Uses it before leaving house, once more at lunchtime, once more before leaving work to go home. Says again that despite multiple reapplications, product doesn't cake up.
* Overall just a comfortable product to use.
* Emphasizes again that she does not recommend this product if you'll be out in the sun for long periods of time, like if you're going to the beach.
* Because of how big the cushion is, it might seem like you can apply the sunscreen more quickly. However, it's precisely because of the size of the cushion that it could be hard to apply the sunscreen thoroughly. So be careful that you're not missing any spots.
* When she's doing makeup tutorials with cushion foundations, she always says to make sure to go over your whole face with just one press into the cushion. With cushion sunscreens, however, that's way too little product. 
* So for this product, she'll press into the cushion, cover one part of her face, and press into the cushion again before moving onto a different part of her face. 
* You only get [this much product](https://imgur.com/MyNYJUK) with one press/tap.
* Fold the cushion [and apply like this](https://imgur.com/vln1Ub7) for harder to reach areas, like around nose.
* When you're done applying, go over once more with cushion to smooth everything out. [Results](https://imgur.com/M60XiDu)

983,AsianBeauty,Fermented Rice Hair Products??,"So we all know how great fermented rice products are for your skin, but I'm interested in the benefits for  scalp and hair. According to [an article](https://theklog.co/rice-water/) on Klog, "" A [**scientific study in 2010**](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2010.00605_3.x/abstract)  revealed that washing hair with rice water decreased surface friction and increased elasticity, resulting in hair that stayed stronger and healthier for longer. "" Personally, I love using fermented rice products on my face. The Kuramoto bijin hakumai ferment sake kasu lotion is maybe one of the more transformative AB products I've used, but I digress. Apparently there is a long history of the fermented rice water being used as a hair rinse. Geisha's would bathe in sake, and the Yao women of China rinse their hair in fermented rice water. I've gone down a bit of a rabbit hole when diving into the topic of ""rice wine for hair"" ...I figured it was time to  turn to reddit. So here's the discussion:

&amp;#x200B;

What do you know about using Rice Ferment Filtrate on hair?

Do you know of any AB shampoos containing Rice Ferment Filtrate?

&amp;#x200B;

Wacky side note: Im much too lazy to be fermenting my own rice water once a week for a hair rinse, so I'm considering rinsing my hair in nigori sake once a week.  Can anyone foresee this having some sort of catastrophic effect on my hair?

&amp;#x200B;

984,AsianBeauty,Skin thickness?,"Hi there,

I heard that depending on how thick your skin is, your products can absorb more or less better. Also, oily skin people are more prone to have thicker skin too. Is that true? For all the people out there with thick skin, how can you know for sure that your skin is thick ? Does your products hardly absorb or something similar ? How do you take of it knowing that ? 


For my own case, sometime I feel like my skin is so thick that even a layer of toner doesnt fully absorb into it. All my moisturizers just sit on my face and I can remain sticky and greasy for hours it just wont fully absorb. Is it actually the cast for everyone with oily skin ?",t3_c3y9lq
985,AsianBeauty,Can anyone help to dissect this article?,"Admittedly this article is not really AB related but this sub is the best I know of in terms of knowledge of chemicals applicable to skincare &amp; beauty. So apologies beforehand if it's not appropriate.

So I got shown this article by a relative: https://amp.businessinsider.com/dangerous-chemicals-in-beauty-products-makeup-list-2019-6 

I kind of can tell that this article has a lot of fearmongering components. For example the section on parabens doesn't really have much fact to support the headline. And I do remember reading somewhere on this sub about asbestos in cosmetics. Do also remember learning about sulfates in shampoos somewhere in this sub.

But for the other chemicals...I can't quite put a finger to why/in what way are they inaccurate. Will appreciate if someone can help explain? 
(PS: If those other chemicals had already been discussed in this sub, a link to the relevant post(s) will be much appreciated.)
